I note that you make no such case as you claim can be 'even more
easily made'.  Yes, the argument can (and has) been made that current
government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were
in the first place, but there is no such term as 'government failure',
since the government can change policies whenever it pleases.  The
market doesn't do that and is governed by (relatively) well-understood
forces.  This libertopican bilge about 'moral arguments' about
taxation, etc., is, at bottom, so much simplistic economic thinking.
It can only be 'justified' by cliche derision of anyone who knows more
about economics than the libertopian -- which is what invariably
happens.  Tripe a la Tommy, the new libertopian dish.

If you don't agree with Joseph's accurate statement of the Catholic dogma
of Mary's perpetual sinlessness, then how do you interpret Luke 1:28,

	And when the angel had come to her, he said, ""Hail, full of 
	grace, the Lord is with thee.  Blessed art thou among women.""

and Luke 1:48? 

	...for, behold, henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

I suppose that these verses might be interpreted to mean that Mary was
possessed of some limited quantity or quality of grace, just as some of 
filled to the brim, incapable of containing more.  The only other people we 
know of who have an abundance of grace are those souls existing in heaven now 
(another Catholic dogma, based on the communion of saints, as I explained in 
an earlier post).  Full of grace to me means sinless, and anyone who has 
ever sinned in his life cannot be without sin in the same sense as Mary  
was sinless.  

As a Catholic, I too find certain of the dogmas tough to embrace.  But
that's where the Catholic faith and prayer come into play.  I pray God
to strengthen my will to accept the faith given the bride of Christ,
which in turn usually strengthens my community faith in His Church.  And,
as you probably know, faith in Christ's Church is tantamount to faith in
Christ inasmuch as the Church is Christ's Mystical Body.  A Catholic by
nature must have two aspects to his faith in Christ: (1) a personal faith in 
Christ as his own personal redeemer and (2) a community faith in the Church 
as the body of Christ.

The norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. In the third period
Juha Riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound, the time was around 5 mins or so.
The second goal was scored by Kari Harila, who shot straight from a faceoff

It took three days to get to us, but I'll try anyway as I naturally
haven't seen the answer.


SAFE. The correct call is ""Infield Fly, (batter out) if fair"". Runners
may advance at own risk. (Gotta tag up if caught, etc.) It is not a
force, and the pop was not caught, so regardless of whether the SS
tags 3B or 2B (it wasn't clear, above), he hasn't got the runner out.


OUT. See rule 6.05(L) APPROVED RULING. (Below). In this case, the
umpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule
doesn't apply. (Sounds like a bad call here, but that's not the
point). The batter is not out, so a force situation is created.
Therefore, the runner is out.  ( UNLESS, by rule 6.05(L) the ball is
dead AND the batter is safe, then I guess the runners would advance
unmolested.  I can't really tell from 6.05(L) that the ball is dead in
this situation.)


Pertinent rules: 2.00 Definition of Infield Fly: ""When an Infield fly
is called, runners may advance at their own risk. If on an infield fly
rule, the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball, the ball remains
in play despite the provisions of Rule 6.05(L). The Infield Fly rule
takes precedence.""

6.05(L) A batter is out when: an infielder intentionally drops a fair
fly ball or line drive, with first, first and second, first and thrid,
or first,second and third base occupied before two are out. The ball
is dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base
or bases. APPROVED RULING: In this situation, the batter is not out if
the infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground,
except when the infield fly rule applies.

A developable surface is s.t. you can lay it (or roll it) flat on the
plane (it may require you to give it a ""cut"" though...)

E.g., a cylinder, a cone, a plane (of course!) or any surface or patch
having vanishing Gaussian (intrinsic) curvature (i.e., with singular
Hessian, the matrix of 2nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch)
are ""developable"". In more technical words, a developable surface is
""locally isometric to a plane"" at all points.


Think also of the sphere (or the earth) which in a non-developable:
whatever way(s) you cut it, you will not be able to lay flat any pieces
of it... (its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing).

Actually, that's based on the NHL's history of 7 games.  The statstical
odds of winning one straight game -- 50/50.  Two straight games -- 25%.  Three
straight games -- 12.5%, 4 straight games = 6.25%.  The odds of the Penguins
winning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061%.  Of course, this doesn't
include weighted average, but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight (a weaker
team) along with beating the Rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has made
the act balanced out.  That's about right.  For Boston the odds of winning are
probably closer to 10% (with weighted average) since Buffalo's record isn't as
good and Boston has a stronger team.  Enough about my QBA probabilities though!
It's just goes to prove ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, if you integrate that to Debbie

Moog gets about ***'s out of 5 for his performance from me.  I give Blue 4

It's very frustrating to lose, and you've gotta say something.  Actually
it's not about winning or losing, it is how you play the game.  But when the
competition is magnified to this level, 99.9% of the people only care about
who wins or loses :-)


I think Buffalo will win in 6 -- it's not like Boston is getting blown away.
They lost 2 OT games -- with a different bounce, they could easily be up 2-1.

during the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch -
off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of
Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of
terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in
favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they
massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing
to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their
very lives.
	I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part
Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the

I'm not sure why you don't consider it an option.  No one suggests that
such analysis should be left to ""regulators.""  In fact, the ""re-inventing
government"" movement provides just such a cost/benefit approach to the
analysis of public spending.  Libertarians would do well to learn more
about it. 


Sorry, but it strikes me that it is the only ""feasible"" approach.  What is
not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and 
licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent
tasks.


Actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as 
generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense.
(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to
be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending
that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)


Perhaps you have.  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries
frequently generate support by acting as protectors of ""geezers,"" 
mothers and children.  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds
that ""we don't have much to fear"" from them do so at their own peril.

	Israel has a right to keep Jerusalem for many reasons.  They
include the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, the
fact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and the
historical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.

	When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948,
the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit
religious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan,
who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  The
Jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned a
Jewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their
latrines.

	Israel has allowed individuals of all religions into
Jerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness to
control the city.

	Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered in
Jerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca,
where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).  Unlike Israeli
Jerusalem, Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca.

There are several reasons for this difference.  The main reason is that
good hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull)
are rarely regular DH's, even if they can't field; it's more commonly a
place to put aging veterans.

Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury
slowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the
field.  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH's than they did
during the rest of the season.

A third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first
or the outfield don't hit as well as DH's for some reason.  Reggie
Jackson was a good example; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, he
hit like the old Reggie when he was in right.

The second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by
their primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60
at DH will count only in the right fielders' averages.


This makes sense; you might also look at it another way.  Although the
*average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left
fielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly
lower; if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a job
anywhere, then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at DH.

"Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some
help with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in
addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray
level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to
format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial
problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a
parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4
bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the
256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video
signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they
did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but
they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they
would call Japan, etc.

Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images
from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not
like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on
getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would
greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

From the FAQ:

Subject:  96)! What is this link problem with libXmu on SunOS 4.1.[23]?

        In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts
with the way X builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols, notably,
to be undefined when building some X11 clients:
        _get_wmShellWidgetClass
        _get_applicationShellWidgetClass
Compiling ""-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic"" appears to work.

To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please
contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:

"1)  Output offset:  Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope
and adjust the internal output offset contorl.  There is virtual
certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset
control's zero detent position.

2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  Many
generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  Go to a hamfest
flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm
terminator that has a male and female BNC (or whatever) connector
on it.  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out
.4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  You may
also find that loading the output of the function generator also
reduces the harmonic distortion.

Build an attenuator.  You don't have to use (and I wouldn't want to
use) the input impedance of the device under test as part of the
voltage divider to drop the input test voltage.  Consider this:

Gen            50 ohm            D.U.T.

-----------------+-------------------

Think about the ratio of 50/10K and then think about the accuracy
to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.  You can
virtually discount the loading of the D.U.T.  Also you have the
millivolt test generator you want.

Well, -I've- been reading t.p.m. for a while and here is what I saw
YOU write:


  >For balance, perhaps you should mention the mosques in Jerusalem that
  >were razed after the Israeli victory in 1967.  An eye for an eye, I guess.

Your statment clearly tries to ""balance"" Arab atrocities by noting a
single incident by the Israelis in war-time at their most holy site.
You even characterize it as ""an eye for an eye"".  


  >That would be false.  If you read your history, you will learn that
  >right after the 1967 war, the victorious Israelis decided to raze a
  >section of the newly captured East Jerusalem, near the Wailing Wall.
  >It is in this section that mosques were razed.

so now you have to find some source that notes that more than 1 mosque
was razed.  You then followed it with:

  >This episode is an example of a good government running amok with
  >newly acquired power.  

Really?  Do you still feel that Israelis are comparable in the running
amok with power with, say, the Iraqis?  Your ""eye for an eye""
comparisons don't match the realities that most of us are familiar
with.


This happened to be during a war!  And a fierce and mighty war it was,
too.  Would you say that the Jordanians ""indiscriminately shot up
ancient structures as is their custom"" in describing bullet holes in
the walls of the city?  This was war!  It was certainly not any ""eye
for an eye"" characterstic.  Israelis do not harbor the same feelings
of revenge as the Arabs generally do.  This is one of the reasons that
the Peace Now movement exists in Israel and nowhere else in the M.E.

Hmm.  The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked as
officers and yelling ""Police"" repeatedly.  This is used every day to bust drug
houses.  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and
display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  As for not knocking, it's
a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even
fight.  Usually this strategy works; if it didn't, then it wouldn't be used so
commonly, now would it?

Whether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my
point, since I don't think any of us have enough information to make a clear
judgement on this issue.

I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day.
Furthermore, we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending
potentially dangerous and armed suspects.  Do you suggest that the police
always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have
been allowed to inspect the officers's badges?  Just what should the police do
when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects?  How far can they
reasonably go to identiy themselves?  What do you suggest they can do which
can't be faked by the ""competition""?

"Wm Hathaway comments;



I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to
impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to
somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment
of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded
by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be
sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least,
our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts
that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out,
not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all
of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach
that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the
'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally
unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern
sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal.
I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that,
just because it has changed the way we strive.

BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.  Sometimes they make
it better.

The events I saw were:
1)  Called strike by Hirschbeck
2)  Shocked-looking Gant asks for appeal to first
3)  No appeal to first
4)  Gant steps out of batters box.
5)  Hirschbeck *immediately* orders Gant back in.  [bad move]
6)  Gant ignores Hirschbeck and walks off. [bad move]
7)  Hirschbeck yells at Gant.  Gant is silent.
8)  Hirschbeck calls for the pitch.
9)  Pitch is called a strike.
10)  Cox argues (couldn't see when he came on the field)
11)  Cox is ejected, players everywhere
12)  Play finally resumes.

Gant shouldn't have ignored Hirschbeck.  Not returning made the strike
call fairly likely.  Although I suspect an argument might have gotten
Gant tossed altogether.  But if Hirschbeck had let Gant step out, the
whole incident probably would have been avoided.

For my money the primary danger of anti-cult groups is that they are
every bit as wacky as the groups they oppose and that by and large
they have no compunctions about printing lies, half-truths and
misleading innuendos as part of their exposes.  A recent book on
cults I picked up by a ""Christian"" author quite simply mixed in
all non-Christian religions (except the Jews) and various New Age
groups with various fringe groups of dubious intent and legality.


Given the record of American Christianity, any group that falls
into the category of fundamentalist or born-again is automatically
into the Inquisition business.  It is an unavoidable affliction
of those who have a proprietary license on The Truth (tm).
And let's not forget that Jonestown and the Branch Davidians are
just as much a part of the Christian tradition as the Missouri Synod
Lutherans, and may in fact be the Massadas of true Christian believers.

I am far more concerned about the encroachment of overtly Christian
indoctrination into public schools than I am about yoga classes there.

inquisitiorial bent:

It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not
the result of the natural process of evolution (but rather an ""act of God"")
and then in the same post say that these other processes (volcanos et al.)
are natural occurrences.  Who gave YOU the right to choose what things are
natural processes and what are direct acts of God?  How do you know that
God doesn't cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose
in mind?  It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature I've seen in
the bible.


Adam & Eve (TWO PEOPLE), even tho they had the honor (or so you christians
claim) of being the first two, definitely do NOT represent a majority in
the billions and trillions (probably more) of people that have come after
them.  Perhaps they were the majority then, but *I* (and YOU) weren't
around to vote, and perhaps we might have voted differently about what to
do with that tree.  But your god never asked us.  He just assumes that if
you have two bad people then they ALL must be bad.  Hmm.  Sounds like the
same kind of false generalization that I see many of the theists posting
here resorting to.  So THAT's where they get it... shoulda known.

Due to advances in composite fuels, engines are now available for model
rockets using similar composites to SRB fuel, roughly 3 times more 
powerful than black powder motors.  They are even available in a reloadable

from D all the way to M in common manufacture, N and O I've heard of
used at special occasions.

To be a model rocket, however, the rocket can't contain any metal 
structural parts, amongst other requirements.  I've never heard of a
model rocket doing 50,000.  I have heard of > 20,000 foot flights.
These require FAA waivers (of course!).  There are a few large national

be part of an educational institute or company involved in rocketry.

Amatuer rocketry is another area.  I'm not really familiar with this,

Good grief!  I do believe that for once you may have an argument which may
be discussed intelligently!

I guess that you are a person who dislikes contact with people of ethnic
minority.  However, your argument again falls flat on its face.  You state
that you, under an anti-discrimination bill, would be forced to associate
with others [homosexuals, I assume] against your will.  How do you know that
you do not associate with them now, except they may be closeted?   Would you
like to change your argument to read ""forced to associate with truthfully
homosexual people against my will""?  You have no proof that anyone you
now know may not be homosexual and this punches a large hole in your
argument.  Is it your belief that a homosexual comes in only one flavour (sic)
and that is the camp mincing type?  Prove it.  You cannot.

I must admit though, that it looks as if you actually thought about your response

       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual 
boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industry
that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's
more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system
as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  

       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they
usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the
way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,
rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about ""thermal 
pollution"" de-icing a river, said, ""Up here, we view heat as a resource"".  

       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is 
purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when
the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than 
cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.",sci.electronics

The HC711 is an EPROM version of the HC11. Raw HC11 parts have factory set
ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have
EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.

Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user
programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. The
more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dip
varieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposing
the EPROM array to light.

The general convention is that if it doesn't have a country tag on it, it's
a US site. That includes:
	.com	commercial 
	.edu	educational 
	.mil	US Military sites 
	.gov	US Gov't non-military sites (eg NASA sites)
	.org	anyone who is ""none of the above""
There are sites with such tags that are non-US sites, but they will have
the country extension (eg xxxx.edu.au is an extension I saw today).
US sites can also use the .us extension, but, as Mr. Smith pointed 
out, the Internet was built on the ARPANet backbone, and they default
to US sites if there's no country code.

I would suggest that anyone who didn't know this (or wants to know
more about it on a non-system-administrative level) check out
the book _The_Whole_Internet_User's_Guide_and_Catalog_ by Ed Krol.

USENET). I don't think it's part of the Nutshell series, but it is

You can design for ramp shutoff, brick-wall current limit or even 
fold-back cutoff....sounds like you want ""BRICK-WALL"" current limit.

Your lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base 
drive. In order to get the brick -wall, you need enough voltage gain on 
the current sensor.  Normally a darlington on the current sensing 
resistor will be adequate, but for infinite gain.. use an op amp to sense 
the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to 
turn off the base bias on the series-pass transistor.  Phase compensation 
may be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more 
than 180 degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain OK??",sci.electronics

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents
windows, a misfeature of the X protocol, and a bug in the Xt intrinsics.  

The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (x,y) position given in
ReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a window
is popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. 
At this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date.

If a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks it
needs to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it
there.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow
request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The
Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out after
wmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex because
the request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the
same.)

The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information
in ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5
public fix 20.  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in
gorier details.

As I understand, that number is deceptive.  The reason is that the money
cost was in non-oil sales for the most part.  Iraq still is not allowed
to sell oil, or do many of the things under the initial sanctions, but
is still surviving.


Of the ~93% (I have heard figures closer to 80%, but I won't quibble your
figures), most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by
enemy troops.  A B-52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie, and we used them
around the clock.  Not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb
munitions.  

2.  The Patriot uses a proximity fuse.  The adjusted figures for number
of Patriot kills of SS-1 derivitives is ~60-70%.  That figure came
not from some fluke in the Pentagon, but a someone working with such
stuff in another part of DoD.

3.  The statement precision bombing was the norm, is true around areas
where civilians were close to the target.  We dropped by tonnage very
little bombs in populated regions, explaining the figures.  


This figure, is far below all the other figures I have seen.  If it
is indeed accurate, then how do you explain the discrepancy between
that figure, and other figures from international organizations?
Most figures I have seen place the hit ratio close to 70%, which is 
still far higher than your 35%.  Or does your figure say a bomb
missed if the plane took off with it, and the bomb never hit the target,
regardless of whether or not the bomb was dropped?  Such methods
are used all the time to lie with statistics.


I have _never_ seen any source that was claiming such a figure.  Please
post the source so its reliability can be judged.

"Re: Waving...

I must say, that the courtesy of a nod or a wave as I meet other bikers while
riding does a lot of good things to my mood... While riding is a lot of fun by
itself, there's something really special about having someone say to you ""Hey,
it's a great day for a ride... Isn't it wonderful that we can spend some time
on the road on days like this..."" with a gesture.

Was sunny today for the first time in a week, took my bike out for a spin down
to the local salvage yard/bike shop... ran into about 20 other people who were
down there for similar reasons (there's this GREAT stretch of road on the way
down there... no side streets, lotsa leaning bends... ;) ... Went on an
impromptu coffee and bullshit run down to puyallup with a batch of people who 
I didn't know, but who were my kinda people nonetheless.

Not to my knowledge; I know GM does conversion work for things like 
hot climates (i.e. the Chevy Caprices sold to the Middle East) but 
things like that are always done by third parties, NOT the manufacturer.
Maybe you will need to buy a specific package that has beefed-up everything,
perhaps the police cruiser package on the Caprice/Crown Vic and start from
there. 


""And I wuz drivin' along in my armored Seville STS and this punk pulls out
of nowhere with an RPG (Rocket Propelled Grenade) but the bulletproof

for bulletproof cars. 

Check with local armored service companies/security/bodyguard places. They'd
know best. I think your average luxury car dealer will have a coronary if
you told them ""I'll take the blue Caprice, with options FZ01 (Fuzzy Dice),
PR11 (power everything), and AR007 (Armor). 


I believe an article on the conversion process appeared in the car press within
the last few months.

on the Times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent
newsworthy value of those speeches.  Likewise to the sysadmin

Your very starting point is wrong.  Christianity is not based on following
a moral standard.  ""For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith...
NOT BY WORKS so that no man may boast.""  (Eph. 2:7-8)  You say that
you know the Bible well, and can recognize (do you mean recite?) many
passages from memory.  That could very well be so.  However, it looks like
there are a few more passages that you should pay attention to.  (Titus 3:5
and James 2:10 are among them.)

Obedience to the moral law is imporant.  However, it is supposed to be the
result of turning your life over to Christ and becoming a Christian.  It is
by no means the starting point.

Look how long the Maple Leafs and Nordiques used similar logic....  Not that
they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams, but the Maple Leafs (and a
certain dead man who was in charge) were one of the cheapest teams in the
history of the sport.  Guess what-- they were immensely popular at the
gate.  The Nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the
playoffs so many years in a row.


Ha!  Such humor!  They have MAJOR fan problems, namely that on occasion some of
them don't make it home from the match!  The soccer fans tend to be fanatical,
much like the Montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when
they play pathetically.

"I appreciated the follow-ups and replies to my earlier query.  One reply, which
I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one 
of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's
_America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles 
Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT 
translation in the New American Bible.  He noted ""...certain practices have 
been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality, 
and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.""  I note that at my 
parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the

Well, this isn't the right group for this, but I have to say that I don't

our great grandparent got yelled at by their parents for playing cowboys

back then, in fact.
I think the only difference between now and then is that nowadays, when

Recently, I completed a 2 week juice fast (with 3 days of water) and had
two colonics as part of it.  My motivation was primarily spiritual, to
de-toxify from all the crap I've been putting in my body (not like thats
enough to clean it all out but it did have an effect).  Personaly, I
didn't find it an uncomfortable experience (the colonic), lost about
15lbs of beer belly (which hasn't come back over the last month), and
feel great.  One of the things that prompted me to get the colonic was
seeing my 90 year old grandmother chair ridden from colitis (?) from
years of indulgence.

No, but I have several other breakdowns of accidental shootings.
I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists
that he has, so I'd love to have a cite.


Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is
supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber.
(Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under
the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe
manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their
trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.


The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I
can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large
negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that
the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the
number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the
described circumstance) is near zero.


Please do.  Include a cite for those of us who like looking at
context.  Make sure that your source excludes other types of
accidents and suicides that are misreported.  (""Gun cleaning
accident"" is police-speak for ""the family needs the insurance
money."")

of this dubious analogy, at least make it accurate.  And by the way, in Texas
you can drive a car in public (with the proper credentials), but an ordinary
civilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his/her life.

So I won't even consider registration, *manadatory* safety classes, or
*manadatory* liability insurance unless I get a federal law repealing

Gifts of the Spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior.
A lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs.  Jesus said
that people would come to Him saying ""Lord, Lord,"" and proclaiming
the miraculous works they had done in His name.  Jesus would tell
them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know Him, and to
depart from Him.  

That is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual
sin.  If the Holy Spirit were only given to the morally perfect, He would
not be given to me, or any of us.  God can forgive any sin, if we repent.
But people should be careful not to think, ""God has given me a gift of
the Spirit, it must be okay to be gay.""  That is dangerous (see also hebrews
6 about those who have partaken of the Holy Spirit and of the powers of 
the world to come.)


Jesus doesn't ask us to change our own nature.  We cannot lift ourselves
out of our own sin- but we must submit to His hand as He changes our
nature.  Practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates the
morality that God has set forth.  

If you don't believe that, and think those of us who do are just ignorant,

Probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in
emphasis.  Weekends might not be so inviolate (more common to work 7 days
a week in a business), and instead of American Atheists, we would have
similar, religious organizations.  A persons religious belief seems more
as a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions.
Of course, people would have to come up with more fascinating 
rationalizations for their actions, but that could be fun to watch...

It seems to me, that for most people, religion in America doesn't matter
that much.  You have extreemists on both ends, but a large majority don't
make too much of an issue about it as long as you don't.  Now, admittedly,
I have never had to suffer the ""Bible Belt"", but I am just north of it
and see the fringes, and the reasonable people in most things tend to be
reasonable in religion as well.  



I don't bother according a higher value to my thinking, or just about
anybodys thinking.  I don't want to fall in that trap.  Because if you 
do start that, then you are then to decide which is better, says whom,
why, is there a best, and also what to do about those who have inferior
modes of thinking.  IDIC  (Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations.)

Brake rotors and the clutch are the main things.  There has been a clutch 
replacement program; you might check to see if the car is still eligible, 
as it is a change well worth making.  You can also swap the cruddy cable 
shifter for the newer rod shifter, also a change worth making, but that'll 
cost you some $$.

In four replies, I've seen no hard numbers, so here goes:  For traces
on the outside (not inner layers), expect, in 1 oz copper, at 15 amps,
the following temperature rises versus width.  This is from Sams'
""Reference Data for Engineers,"" seventh edition, Pg 5-30, which claims
in turn to be from MIL-STD-275C...

    width   Temp rise
    inches  degrees C
    ------  ---------

     .15	 75
     .17	 60
     .20	 45
     .24	 30
     .33	 20

At 10 amps, the rise for the .125 width is only about 30 degrees.
Power goes as square of the current, plus the copper resistance goes
up as temperature goes up...  Certainly .20"" (~5mm) traces should be 
ample for what you want to do.  And 2 ounce copper almost cuts the 
required width in half.  (I'd do 2 oz at about 0.08"" width myself, 
I think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 is
a transient or fault condition.)",sci.electronics

Then we all live happily ever after. :-)

Seriously, if we all agreed on the circumstances we're in, I suspect we'd all
agree on the best course of action.  Unfortunately, I have no confidence that
such a situation will ever arise. 

Some of us think there's a big God in the sky, some don't.  Some think
they've been chosen by God, others disagree.  Some think they are infallible,
others think otherwise.  Until those disagreements over circumstances can be
ironed out, there's little hope of everyone agreeing.


Yes.  I think that, for example, only a vanishingly small number of people
would hold that there's a frame of reference in which gassing six million
Jews is good.  So that's probably about as close to an objective moral value
as I've encountered in my life so far.


Well, I think your example's poor.  If the bomb's in Iraq, for example, and
was dropped by an American plane, many people would hold that it was a moral
act.


Hmm.  So these moral values have a perceptible physical presence?


Right, and the chain ends right there.  The buck stops with me.  It's not an
infinite regress.


Right.  The key point, however, is that there are vanishingly few of these
moral issues where we can get 99.9% of people to agree on the outcome for all
frames of reference (and agree on the frames of reference...)


I can't manage either.  Killing Hitler using a car bomb would have been a
terrorist act, but I have to admit that I couldn't exactly condemn it. 
Although there are tricky philosophical issues to do with hindsight...


I think that circumstances have already arisen where terrorism would have
been better than peace.  Better in terms of numbers of innocent people
killed.  Assuming it was successful terrorism, of course.

I don't know why it is so obvious.  We are not speaking of acts of the

not to label his emotion as good or bad or to numb ourselves so that
we hide our true feelings, it is to accept ourselves as we are, as God
accepts us.  It seems that Paul's anger he has accepted and channeled
it to a plea to all of us to refrain from passing judgement on those
afflicted with a disease and to reach out to others.  Give in?  Calling
his arguments foolish, belittling them to only quarrels, avoiding action
because of fear to give others a bad feeling, he's not forgiving?

       The classic comment on new encryption algorithms comes from
Friedman:

	""No new cypher is worth considering unless it comes 
	from someone who has already broken a very hard one.""

Historically, Friedman has been right.  It's really hard to develop
a good cypher.  IBM's Lucifer, the precursor to DES, turns out to have
been fatally flawed.  Most of the DES-like systems other than DES seem
to be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis.  The first two tries at
public key encryption (remember knapsack cyphers?) were broken.  Most
if not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were
broken eventually.  Attempts in the computer era to home-brew encryption
have been disappointing; the classic ""A survey of data insecurity packages""
in Cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the
popular ""security packages"" of the late 1980s.

        A new, proprietary algorithm?  No way.

        If the US is permitting general export of this thing, it has
to be weak; that's how the current regulations work.  Currently there's
a willingness to allow systems with short keys (32 bits appears to be
no problem; the 56 bits of DES are too many) or weak algorithms
(I think Word Perfect qualifies under that rule) to be exported.
I can't believe these guys shepherded their technique through the 
PTO and the State Department's Arms Control Division without finding that out.

Well... all the way through a decreasing-radius corner, anyway...


OK (but I'm right!)  :^)


If that's the ""official line"" taught in those rider education classes
you were refering to, that also don't teach countersteering, I have to
question the quality of the classes.  The ""official line"" in MSF
curricula is as I described.  Maximum braking is achieved by applying
both brakes equally, when the weight distribution is nominally even and
both tires have equal normal forces, and easing off on the rear to
prevent locking it, and increasing braking on the front, as more
traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to
weight shift.

The ""official line"" you have been taught seems ineffective on the face
of it.  Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage
of all the traction available to the rear at time 0, and is halving the
available braking power by using only the front at time 0.


Not necessarily true.  ""Chirping"" the tire indicates impending lockup

maximum braking.  I agree that totally locking the front occasionally
makes one a better rider, but it is a manuver best saved for an
experienced rider, unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like
Code used to use.


True, but from the point of view of how to best *teach* riding skills
(which is how this discussion started), ""keep both wheels just on the
point of sliding"" is nearly useless information.  You need to teach a
*technique*, or at least a strategy, to achieve this.

  <Endless remarks of how the Davidians could have surrendered deleted.>
 

  If they had been quiet there would have been no deaths??  I thought thier
neighbors said that the Davidians never bothered them.  Oh, well, that couldn't
have been your point, then.  

  If they hadn't been stockpiling weapons, then the ATF wouldn't have felt 
threatened and had to move in.  Here's a newsflash:  It isn't illegal to
own more than one firearm.  It isn't even illegal to own *lots* of firearms.
 
  They shot federales?  The feds shot them, too.  

  How about that staying inside thing?  Here's another newsflash:  sometimes
the government does nasty things to you that you don't deserve.  Since
they were so nice to the Davidians the first time round, I can see why
the Davidians didn't surrender so easily, especially because they were
expecting the end of the world.

"Flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires.  A fire will
start small and in one location and heat the air.  The temperature in
the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches
fire at once.
 
This may have occurred in the BD compound, I have heard reports that
the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed
by those outside the compound.  When the fire got big enough, and
broke through the walls, it appeared to be started in two places but
was really one big fire.
 
Because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building
it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free
of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas.
When they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them
to escape.  They were trapped by the flames in their safe room.
 
I find it hard to believe that the FBI was not recording the final

Obviously, we have different sources. Bill Moyers (who happens to be a
theist, to tie this to alt.atheism!) in his PBS documentary ""After The
War"" is my main source. (I think I still have it on videotape.) Others
include The Nation and The Progressive.

The rest of the article is mere rationalisation. You may claim that
sanitation plants are strategic ""legitimate"" targets, but what happens to
the civilians in a city with no sewer system? What happens to the
civilians when you destroy water purification plants? And when hospitals
can't handle the resultant epidemics, because there is no more electricity?

And what exactly are your sources? We have all, I'm sure, seen Postol's
interviews in the media where he demostrates how the Pentagon lied about
the Patriot's effectiveness; what is your source for the 70%

Oh PULLEEZE!

It's not biology at all, it's clothing design.  Women's clothing is
generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  It's only been
in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with
pockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously, deep pockets were
virtually unknown in women's clothing.  Skirts generally have better
pockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty
hopeless.  I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're
dressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a
purse.

If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the
manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think
manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  There's
an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described
what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the
need for functional women's clothing.  The manufactuing industry
lost millions.

long legs and high waists than women's clothing without....

That's fine idea, but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures.  For instance, a power company in Virginia 
recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various
type.  Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell
were bad designs - one that wasted the light.  Thus, you couldn't even buy
a good light from them.  In most places, to get a good light, you have to
either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona.  At some
point, society starts to make rules.  Cars have to pass safety tests.  
Companies have to meet pollution standards, etc..  There are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code
down the lighting companies backs.  History seems to suggest that the latter
is more likely to work.

Agreed, so I won't respond again.  It's important for all you spacers out

	It isn't so much a matter of 'interpretation' of Bible texts 
that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of 
*fabrication*.

	About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips 
in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called ""Son o' God"" comics. 
It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a 
group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said 
the magic word, he turned into ""Son o' God."" He went from a myopic, 
curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied 
portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile 
features.	

	Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus, 
and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this 
NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since 
this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.

	This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim 
that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus 
that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the 
NatLamp Jesus was.

Traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it 
yourself if you don't mind that extra hassle.  Having a trade-in on a purchase
just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing.


I assume this is _retail_ bluebook.  There are two bluebook prices, one for
retail and one for wholesale.  You really want the retail price if you can 
get it.  The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage
and extras on your particular car.  You should look all this stuff up yourself.
Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country
that may not apply in your area.  For example, blue book prices are low for
California.  A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is
to call around and see what it's selling for (if any used lots have one) or
looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices.  It 
might be more time efficient to take a small loss (rather than hold out for
6 months for the best price).


I don't know what you mean by ""an acquaintance"" but I would make darn sure
that I was paid, that is, cashier's check in full before delivery.  There's
a real temptation when selling to a pseudo-friend to be more accomodating
than you should.  Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying
in full at the start (with a cashier's check or cash) then I would go
elsewhere.  Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot
or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook.  That's probably a safer approach
than selling to a private party.

  Yes, I do.  

  My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to
  kill people.  That is it's primary (and I would argue only)
  purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has
  almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing
  innocents, is unconscionable.

  At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our
  transportation system are based on their merits to society, not
  their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent
  lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued
  existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and
  the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.

  Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital
  punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with
  no net positive gain.  Why?

  Were you to pin me in a corner and ask, I would have to respond
  that I don't belief the state should have the right to take life
  at all.  But I won't open that debate, as it seems others are
  tiring of this thread on a.a anyway.

Paul,

Unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock
just about every chip made.  The stuff they will stock are the ones
that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.
i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.

The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or
the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip
through them.

Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics,
etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where
we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy
by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of
different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?
Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good
bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.
They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer
they represent.

Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.
But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2
qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what
a mail order outlet will charge.

My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick
with off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use
too many esoteric parts sooner or later.

" OK, I should have read the thread before posting my own $0.02.  I would
just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the
fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  (""...nor shall any person .
. . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself..."").
Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be
civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection.
Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to
criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part
of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as 
to the location of the child--this is routine.  A ""computer crime"" 
prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense, 
where a suit by a party injured by ""hackers"" would not.  If I am accused, 
for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should 
protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however,
it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a ""crime"" in the
technical sense.)  The REALLY tricky question is, say I do both (naughty
boy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civil
trial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal
prosecution.  The answer should certainly be no, but lord only knows how

I would expect the EISA board to be more than twice as fast as the ISA
board.  Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at
least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for
bus transactions between the two busses.  Most ISA boards require
multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4.
EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so I
would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card.  

So I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still.  I would expect
him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does
not.

  Supports resolutions up to 1280x1024 interlaced or non-interlaced
  Uses RAMDAC to allow up to 32k colors in 800x600, 65k colors in 640x480
  Register level compatible with CGA, EGA, VGA, MDA
  Software drivers available for 1-2-3, Symphony, Autocad, Autoshade,
   Windows, Wordperfect, VESA and 8514/A Emulation
  also contained on the card:
    Local Bus IDE controller
    Floppy Disk controller
    Two fully configuarable serial ports
    1 Parallel port
    1 Game port

  I used this setup to run AutoCad and 3D Studio.  The combination of
 Local Bus and the Weitek co-processor made for VERY fast CAD and modeling
 work.  The Weitek coprocessor can cut 3D Studio render times in half and
 sometimes more.  It also increases redraws and regens when modeling in
 both 3D Studio and Autocad.  Everything is less than a year old.  I am
 asking $950.00 + shipping for the whole package.  Please respond via email.

I've asked your god several times with all my heart to come to me.  I
really wish I could believe in him, 'cos no matter how much confidence
I build up on my own, the universe *is* a big place, and it would be
so nice to know I have someone watching over me in it...

I've gone into this with an open mind.  I've layed my beliefs aside
from time to time when I've had doubt, and I've prayed to see what
good that would do.  I don't see what more I can do to open myself to
your god, short of just deciding to believe for no good reason.  And
if I decide to believe for no good reason, why not believe in some
other god?  Zeus seems like a pretty cool candidate...

All I know is that in all my searching, even though I've set aside my
pride and decided that I want to know the truth no matter how
difficult it may be to accept, I have never had any encounter with any
deity, Christian or otherwise.

Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to myself.

Yeah, Morris just knows how to win. That's why he lost 18 for Detroit in
1990. Funny how he wins a lot of games when he pitches on good teams but
loses a lot when he pitches on bad ones. And if ""rings"" was the only
criteria for success, then teams would always tend to repeat, and
eventually you'd have the same team win the WS every bleepin' year. Sort
of like the yanks in the 50s.

Morris is a decent pitcher on the downside of a good, not great, career.

"#>So instead of calling it interest on deposits, you call it *returns on investements*

#No, interest is different from a return on an investment.  For one
#thing, a return on an investment has greater risk, and not a set return
#(i.e. the amount of money you make can go up or down, or you might even
#lose money).  The difference is, the risk of loss is shared by the
#investor, rather than practically all the risk being taken by the
#borrower when the borrower borrows from the bank.

But is it different from stocks ?  If you wish to call an investor in stocks as
a banker, well then its your choice .....

#>Relabeling does not make it interest free !!
#
#It is not just relabeling, as I have explained above.

It  *is* relabeling ...
Also its still not interest free. The investor is still taking some money ... as
dividend on his investment ... ofcourse the investor (in islamic *banking*, its your
so called *bank*)  is taking more risk than the usual bank, but its still getting some
thing back in return ....

Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring
and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener
and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever
scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on 
the frontend.

Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm
equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets
dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly
12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that
far down is probably a big no-no.

The easiest implementation to accomplish the above??

	Not necessarily.  As Shai points out, political appointments are
based on power.  They are also based on favors owed, coalition
building, and deal making.  While this may have a racist element to
it, I think that its much more fair to attribute it to the ""old boy""
nature of politics.  Now, I'll freely admit that the old boy system
has racist and sexist effects, but I don't think that those are its
purpose, whether in the US, Israel, or elsewhere.

Personally, I'll be blasphemous and say that if Microsoft keeps doing
what it does so well, I hope to see much harsher/stricter copyright
and patent laws for computer algorithms, concepts, interfaces, and
other intellectual properties to protect real innovators. I'd hate to
be one who actually does innovate, and then have Microsoft come in
like a huge vulture and use their brute mass (development staff,
marketing, etc) to get fat off of my innovation. I don't have all
that much sympathy for Apple's complaint against Microsoft, since
they just took the ideas from Xerox's PA Research Center when the
Federal government forced Xerox to disclose their patents over
antitrust fears. However, for other companies and individuals who
have a great idea, yet get it ""borrowed"" by larger corporations who
can afford to quickly bring it to market, without any licensing from
the original innovator, I feel much sympathy.

I can't speak for Mr. Cavano, but I understood his comment to refer to 
the idea that unrecognized pantheism is dangerous to Christians.  If we 
unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity, 
we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we 
encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with 
Christianity and reject what isn't.    

We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine 
the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch 
and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.  
Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our 
lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and 
service.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy-
headed drifting from idea to idea. 


One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme 
in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions 
recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It 
too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.  Thank you, Jack, for 
pointing out the parallel. ",soc.religion.christian
"A few random thoughts on riding with a passenger:

There's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power, having taken
passengers very occasionally on the small (125 etc) bikes I used to
ride in the UK it was hard ! I'm now riding a GS1100 and that's great,
even moving from my freinds GSX600 I was riding recently. This may be due
in part to the fact that neither I, nor my regular passengers, are
particularly slimline !

I always tell passengers, stay in line with the bike on corners, that makes
their movements predictable.

My regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all,
I don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods.
Again that may be biased by the fact that I've had a couple of new passengers
(a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight,
making any kind of maneuvering difficult.

I've also discovered that on longer trips I prefer a passenger who moves and
shifts their weight a bit. I recently took a work collegue to a meeting (about
a 1 hour ride) and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also
sitting very still and getting a sore back.

tests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) are
not very interested in starting medication as this ""deactivates"" the 
gland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple of 
monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given
some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the

Her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on the
probability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eat
normally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels
that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this

   The whole question of ""a right to a dark sky"" revolves around the
definition of a right.  Moral rights and natural rights are all well and
good, but as far as I can see, a right is whatever you or someone
representing you can enforce.  In most civilizations, the government or
the church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, and
then enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S., the constitution
provides a ""Bill of Rights"" from which most if not all legal rights are
considered to derive.  I'm sure that most other countries have
comparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a right
to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights (in the

keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law

fact that the students get their ancient language-learning out of the
way early [I'm not a theology student, but I spend a lot of time with
such folks] in their careers.  They take the first two years or so to just
do Greek and Latin and Hebrew [possibly Aramaic, too--who knows].

The easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured. This makes
the funding separate from government.

It also has the neat side property that if the chip doesn't catch on, the
scheme breaks down, and the government is back to the drawing boards,
assuming that they haven't prohibited alternatives in the meantime.

In fact, maybe this should be part of the ""official"" system. Before the
government is allowed to move this past the ""experimental"" stage, they
should have to demonstrate economic viability by mass adoption. The
government is very fond of demonstration projects proving feasibility in the
use of government funds for social programs--they should have to make a
similar feasibility demonstration (on economic viability cum acceptance
terms) for this baby as well. Let's put it to the only vote that counts--a

"I watched the final inning of Bosio's no-hitter with several people at
work. After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the
middle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he
wouldn't have had time to throw Riles out. Yet, the throw beat Riles
by about two steps. I wonder how many others who watched the final out
think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.
Does anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? And
if he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an
error or a hit? (Judging from Bosio's grimace when the ball bounced
past him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) Whether
Vizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play.

The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because

The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the

He's been playing horrible defense. Baylor said after Wednesday's game that
he wanted to shake up the lineup a little, because Bichette has been
having a rough time defensively and Jerald Clark has not been hitting.
He was true to his word; I went to Thursday's game and Gerald Young
was in right and Daryl Boston (who has a very hot bat) was in left.
Baylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for
these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two
a shot while Clark and Bichette were not playing well.

In defense of Bichette, it looks like right field in Mile High Stadium

The Habs tied this sucker at 2 and the teams now head for Quebec
City to play game 5.  BTW, final score was Habs 3-Nords 2.

The score might be a bit misleading.  The Habs dominated the game
from the 5:00 mark of the first and then on.  The score should have
been 8-2 if it weren't for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall
(bastard!).  He's the reason the score was as close.  Habs winning
goal was scored by Benoit Brunet at 1:07 of the 3rd.

Roy had an OK game.  He made the first save (one way or another)
and the defense was there to clear any rebounds.

This just in, ESPN radio reports that the Bruins lost 6-5 in OT.

"Recently I've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon
cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.  In
particular, Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book ""Colon Cleansing for
Health and Longevity"" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very
similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics,
along with certain orally ingested ""debris-loosening agents"", boosts
the immune system to a significant degree.

He also plugs a unique appliance called the ""Colema Board"", which
facilitates the self-administration of colonics.  It sells for over
$100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Tox
products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash,
supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its
bulkiness.

If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its
particulars, or the Colema Board and related products, I'd be very
interested to hear about research and personal experience.

I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two cents...

The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ).
The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can
operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.

A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data
from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data
and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate
even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape
units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is
issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other
devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do
something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be
what I am doing while reading this group.

Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,
thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is
better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to
completely get rid of IDE.

coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of
those drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, except
for those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with you
about the LW Pro design.


    Again, its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non-certified

The way I understand what happened is that she discussed with Clinton

The Selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals
from being scored- not to score them.  When Lemieux or Gilmour play their
number one purpose is to score- defence is secondary- especially considering
the line that plays against them is probably a defensive one.  That is
why they are not Selke candidates.


Someone posted something about this assumption being lost in translation
(it was a few months ago).  Whoever this was please repost it.


Gainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment.
He was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you
ever watch him play? He never made a technical error.

Of course you never read Arab media,

I read Arab, ISRAELI (Jer. Post, and this network is more than enough)
and Western (American, French, and British) reports and I can say
that if we give Israel -10 and Arabs +10 on the bias scale (of course
you can switch the polarities) Israeli newspapers will get either
a -9 or -10, American leading  newspapers and TV news range from -6
to -10 (yes there are some that are more Israelis than Israelis)
The Montreal suburban (a local free newspaper) probably is closer
to Kahane's views than some Israeli right wing newspapers, British
range from 0 (neutral) to -10, French (that Iknow of, of course) range
from +2 (Afro-french magazines) to -10, Arab official media range from
0 to -5 (Egyptian)  to +9 in SA. Why no +10? Because they do not want to
overdo it and stir people against Israel and therefore against them since 
they are doing nothing.

 

the average bias of what you read would be probably around -9,

not read or read the new-york times and similar News-makers, and
-8 if they read some other RELATIVELY less biased newspapers.",talk.politics.mideast

As I understood it, MSG *is* natural.  Isn't it found in

Anyway, lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural
things; peanuts, onions, tomatoes, milk, etc.  Just because something
is 'natural' doesn't mean it won't cause problems with some folks.

As for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like
the taste of it, why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use
it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor
has an ulcer.

People have long modified the taste of food by additives, whether
they be chiles, black pepper, salt, cream sauces, etc.  All of these
things cloud the flavor of the food.  Why do we bother with them?

Hey, can someone clue me in on these and other weird types of amplifiers?  Just
a brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool.  I have the clues 
on type A, B, and AB already and stuff, but these other ones are mentioned 
occasionally and I dont know what they do.  I think type D is like a PWM scheme
or something.  Thanx in advanced.

---------->
The whole point to these weird amplifier types is improved efficiency.

Class D amps *are* PWM (pulse width modulation) amps which work very much like
switching power supplies. I think I've seen these things called ""class S""
before as well. They're capable of very high efficiencies, and would be suitable
for very high power. I've yet to see anything like this used in an audiophile
amp, though.  I've been trying to design a three-kilowatter for the last year
(to be used as an inverter for an UPS), but have been having serious problems
with layout parasitics (10 IRF 450's in parallel... any help  with a  do-able
isolated drive ckt would be appreciated :) ) 

I'm not absolutely positive about this, but I beleive a 'class G' amp is one that
operates off a variable- or switched power supply rail voltage. The Carver
amps do something like this. They use some sort of phase-control circuit 
(I do not fully understand its operation) to reduce the transformer size, and
I beleive that is patented. I had an M400 apart (trying to fix) and found that
it had three rail voltages that it switched between. I ran a simulation on
PSPICE and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation (heat)
under large-signal conditions, or when driving reactive loads (which draw high
current at the zero-voltage crossings). ",sci.electronics

"I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do is
the following;

From a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each having
it's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  Given the
listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the
listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  This
means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's
incoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is
possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles
relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given
angle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the
source.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source
changes position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some
reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined
could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation
simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.  

Have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system?

Never claimed it is a bug.



I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to
many newsgroups.

I wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.
This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images.

Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications
in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image,
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.



Never claimed it is a bug.
I tried kept sure I don't claim that JPEG is noting else than
a compression algorithm, because I know what the JPEG is.
(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many
places so far.)

You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.

"I think I can explain the ""missing part of a leaf"" story.

I have actually seen a reproduction of that particular Kirlian
photograph, in a book compiled by people who were enthusiasts of
Kirlian photography.  ""That particular photograph"" ... ?  That's
right, the effect has been observed only once.  Even the writers of
the book were inclined to disbelieve in it.  

I conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placing
a whole leaf between two plates and taking its Kirlian photo.
For his next experiment, he cut the leaf in half, put one half down
between the same two plates, and took another K. p.  The
""missing half"" effect was created by water, oils, etc. left behind 
after the first photo.

Should we assume that you are refering here to Jews who were kicked
out of their homes in Jerusalem during the Jordanian Occupation of
East Jerusalem?  These are the same people who are now being called

never sold to anyone?

Israel, there is no such crime.  In some times and places BEING a Jew
is a crime, but NOT being a Jew??!!

But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here.  The other x
three instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form
an image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the 
resolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether different
beast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of 
the craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the 
differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors.
Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors
and errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have
any independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to
determine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small 
component to the positional error.  

Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would 
require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort 
cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together 
now: ""Parallax ARc SECond"", a parsec is the distance of an object 
that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line).
If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to 
have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.

The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and
watches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination
when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from.",sci.space

[deletia- and so on]

I seem to have been rather unclear.

What I was asking is this:

Please show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery
programs involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs, rather than
merely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved
by the people, A.A, S.R.C. regulars, or snoopy. This will probably
involve defining ""spritual needs"" (is it not that clear) and
showing that such things exist and how they can be filled.

Annother tack you might take is to say that ""fulfilling spiritual
needs"" means ""acknowledging a ""higher power"" of some sort, then
show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise
identical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you,
but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping
one crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion is
usually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually
poisonous! :) )

I hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable. I actually
did know about the 12 step program, its the question of what it does,
rather than what it tries to do, that makes a difference to me.

Well, I'd say you're mostly right, but for different reasons. (BTW, as of a
couple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750
GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that
most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-
order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily
by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep 
them honest about acquiring parts. 

For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a
HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.
Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are
not as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the 
plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy,
then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it
on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,
more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.

We had a senior NSA scientist in Cambridge at one of our workshops recently

learn of it till after he'd gone). He said on this point that he was forbidden
by law to monitor conversations between US nationals (and he is a chap who is 
very precise about his choice of words). So I don't expect he'd have any qualms
about monitoring a domestic US conversation if one of the parties was an alien.

Not to worry.  The Masons have been demonized and harrassed by almost 
every major Xian church there is.  For centuries now.  And still they 
stand.  They wil withstand the miserable Southern Boobtists, I am sure.
They may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the 
Boobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of 
Satanism that the Masons sound pretty good by comparison.  One thing is 
known.  A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons!  And the 
Masons have already fired back in their own magazines against the 
Boobtist Witch-hunt.
  Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with 
their war on Boobtist moderates and liberals, they may now start in on 
their Mason/Boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and 
more Southern Boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a 
handful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop 
'em out of the leadership positions they have taken over.
  So as far as I am concerned, the louder, ruder, and more outrageous

I received mail from Mitch Kapor saying that he did not ask to be on

Not bad. We had a similar situation. Slowpitch softball, bases loaded,
weakest hitter at the plate. He hits a line drive over the third
baseman's head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in
foul ground, almost hitting the fence down that side of the field.
But the umpire called fair ball! I was coaching third, yelling at evrybody 
to move up a base. The ump's position: ""it was still fair when it
passed third base"". 
Why the other team didn't immediately protest I'll never know; we
certainly weren't going to argue about it, since every body did manage
to advance one base safely.

There was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my (runner
from second base) leg, fielded by the SS, steps on second to force the
runner from first, and throw to first in time for what the umpire
called a triple play; protest removed when we won the game anyway.",rec.sport.baseball

I use it to refer to those Christians who take a more
conservative-literalist approach to the Bible, as distinct from
""liberals"".


I would use the word ""Christian"" (unqualified) to describe someone to
whom the above definition applied.  BTW, it applies to me.

[deletia: Joe Gaut indicates his interest in the BD disaster is from a
civil liberties issue, not an attempt to justify Koresh's beliefs
and/or practices.]

I agree with Joe about this: if some group wants to believe in
whatever god or Invisible Pink Unicorns and go off and live together
and have group sex, or no sex, or sex only for the leaders (but NOT
with children), then, as much as I might believe them to be misguided,
I think they should have the legal right.  And I hope the
investigation will start by determining whether the feds had any
*legitimate* reason for going after Koresh in the first place (before
moving on to consider the wisdom of various tactics used).

[Joe goes on to dispute the child-abuse allegations.  I'll
(provisionally) accept this, unless someone has evidence to support
the allegations?]

Actually I wasn't thinking about the (alleged) child abuse, but about
the reports that he had sex with, and fathered children by, several
women in the cult.  I agree this is not a legal matter - consenting
adults and all that - but Stephen Tice seems to be defending Koresh's
beliefs and practices from specifically *Christian* perspective, not a
civil liberties perspective.  

I think my question is not really aimed at Joe (and possibly not at
Ray Cote either, who seems to also be taking the political angle), but
at Stephen Tice.

propogation of the species.  Another example of a moral system is
presented within the Declaration of Independence, which states that we
should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  You see,
to have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system.  That is,
we shall be moral unto what end?


Well, murder violates the golen rule, which is certainly a pillar of most
every moral system.  However, I am not assuming that our current system
and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral.  I think that
it is a very good approximation, but we can't be perfect.

This is, shall we say, an overly-broad statement.  In particular, are you

that existed in 1800?  (Simplify things by assuming we're talking about
the eastern US rather than the whole continent.)  Given that those were
*radically* different cultures, which one are you referring to?


Note that the pre-Columbian native Americans, east of the Mississippi,
did all of these things.  (Well, maybe not ""on Sunday"", but they did
have organized religions, not to mention cities and governments.)  If
you are judging the native Americans by the tribal culture that existed
in 1800, you might want to read an account of the De Soto expedition

Okay, I see smilies, so this isn't supposed to be a serious post.
On the other hand, I would suppose it does has some motivation behind
it. Apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion, but there is 
presumably some sort of reasoning behind it. As an argument, this 
statement is worthless. Presuming the Qur'an is a perfect religious 
text (whatever that might be) there is still plenty of room for 
disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials.

I've already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made
between two people who in fact _do_ disagree about Islam, which doesn't
presume anything about the Qur'an other than its having sufficient
clarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of
Islam. This hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could have
disagreements about _all_ issues relevant to Islam.

Most programs discriminate, in that given an FMG equally
qualified as an American they will take the American.  What

US citizens (most are not)?  We have had good luck with FMGs
and bad luck.  SOme of our very best residents have been FMGs.
Also, our very worst.  As it turns out, the worst FMGs are often
US citizens that studied in off-shore medical schools.  Of the
5 residents fired for incompetence in the 12 years I've been here 
in my department, all have been FMGs.  3 were US citizens who studied

Hmm.. but the service indicators that I have works this way:
  There are 5 green,1 yellow, 1 red indicators.
  initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start
  your car. The computer will actually ""sense"" how you drive your car and
  as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and
  then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go
  on. And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off.
  
  After service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the
  computer starts counting again.

So I expect to have a tool(or a procedure) to reset it so the green lights will 
come on and the yellow and red lights will go off.

I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the
indicator.

It's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a

not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil.

I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of
the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone
decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper
algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly
difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able
to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a
description of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out 
the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an
uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think
about design decisions made by other designers.

I could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using
""tamperproof"" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive
and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that
there will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication
of the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these
supposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely
reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot
bureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that

I'm afraid that you haven't actually proved that.  You have shown that some
aspects of MSW3.1 are technically inferior to other systems.  As I said
earlier, if this is all you are trying to say then it is trivially true.
But some aspects of MSW3.1 are actually technically superior to each of the

support, GUI etc.)

some of the competition. This still does not prove your point.

I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the 
operations section of NASA was talking about what future missions
were going to be funded.  I don't remember his name or title off hand
and I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was 
asked about that very matter: ""Why can't we spend a few million more
to keep instruments that we already have in place going?""

His responce was that there are only so many $ available to him and
the lead time on an instrument like a COBE, Magellan, Hubble, etc
is 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on using
current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have
very little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that, sure
in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular,
however starting a few years after he had retired he would become
one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not
funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Just
as he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed it
to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new
missions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before
the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.

One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was
the Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just
been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed
several monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the
Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last
year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the
ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing
criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I
scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it
scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.

Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading
reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the
criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product
testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly
know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently
from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the
ranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet
your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of
what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply
more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell
anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you
don't also understand the scoring.",comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

I've had my Duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both
of the above problems. I reinstalled my system software twice
in an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were
system software problems. Initially reinstalling the system
seemed to help but not anymore. Occasionally when I try to
wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on
the screen - it freezes.

I also get the high-pitched hiss occasionally - but only at
startup.

I've called the apple hotline (800 SOS-APPL) three times
already and finally they agreed something is astray after my
Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by
itselft and put itself to sleep. This problem only occured
twice. Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in
New York but the problem now is intermittent and I can't
afford to be without my Duo at this time.

Anyone out there with these same problems?

I was there in 1976.  I suppose it must have died out since 1946,
then.  Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in
the employ of the NHS.  Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities
refused to hire any homeopaths.  A similar law in the US allows
chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one
there and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor.
There are a lot of Britons on the net, so someone should be able to
tell us if the NHS provides homeopaths for you.

Gretzky, Lemieux, Gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman.
They play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one.  If they
were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive
abilities. 

When you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis, Gainey etc you are comparing 
apples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't 
very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of
him.  Sure Lemieux is a better player, but he is a different type of
player.  For a team to be successful, they need to have all types of
players- this includes defensive forwards.

When compared with other defensive forwards, Bob Gainey is the greatest
defensive forward ever.  He is the player who's talents best suited being
a defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played.

Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste his
offensive talents and play defensively, he could have been a better
defensive forward, but he wasn't.

Since the advertising ""is just to help defray costs"", it's certainly no

Great idea, they should have done it long ago.


I can't believe that a mile-long billboard would have any significant

it would have some miniscule impact, it would be only for a short time
as it goes zipping across the sky.


No doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, so
it would be no surprise.

I think some essential information must be missing here, i.e., you must be

no indication for IV acyclovir for shingles in an otherwise healthy

certainly would not subject someone to IV therapy without a good reason.

To address your more general question, IV therapy does provide higher and

Churches never even ""shelter"" Eutyches (the advocator of Monophysitism)

heresy. That is why the Eastren (Chalcedonian) Orthodox Church held
talks with the Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) that started 30 years ago
and still continueing till today, but they have converged on many
issues the most imporatant of which is Christology (I have more

I am new to this newsgroup, and also fairly new to christianity. I was
raised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an

It sounds like your TV is one of the ones that also reacts to the video 
protection.  (Poor you!)

The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you 
souldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of 
copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to 
the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the 
protection.

One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape 
for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an 
extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR 
first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I 
don't know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want 
to make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.",sci.electronics

the gas and so I plan on draining it and replacing it with new gas (I can only
pray that I didn't trash the carbeurators).  The question is, what do I do
with this old gas?  I am not going to run it in my Sabre, and I think that
there is enough that I don't want to burn it (campus police don't think
too kindly about bonfires).  Dumping it isn't a great idea.        

Thanks for any ideas,

The STANDARD AT bus (ISA) runs at 8MHz, not 12.5 MHz, but some 
non-stnadard ISA buses do have higher clock rates, but be careful, since 
some boards don't work with faster than standard rates.  For instance, my 
486 has adjustable AT bus speeds, and my PAS16 audio card chokes when I do 
AD data acquisition with a bus speed faster than 10MHz.

The fact that non-turbo-mode speed A/D doesn't work is weird.  You may 
have a motherboard with a hardware 'bug'.  

33 MHz bus on the 486DX2 66 does refer to the local bus.  FYI: the AT bus 
operates asynchronously, and is linked to the local bus via a 'bus 
interface', which is one function that your 'chipset'.

One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim, they are
wrong.  I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the
right chapter, anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work to
check with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his
impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later
he will be with them.  He said something along the lines of ""I will
be in you and you will be in me.""  (Again I cannot provide the exact
quote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that
the Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward
event, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him.
If you look for a person you will be deceived.

It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would
be a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus when
he came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth.
A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to
based on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over
the world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot like
what the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn't like that and
I see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.

Oh and by the way, I don't expect it to happen once.  There is no one
Second Coming, there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christ
comes into someones heart, Christ has come again.

Peace,
Will.

This, at least, has already been determined: The Blue Cross medical
coverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future

must always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital,
you must notify Blue Cross, or they will refuse to pay your bills. 
In an emergency, where you must be treated before notifying them, 
you must inform them within 24 hours or (if you are unable to do
so for medical reasons) the hospital must. Failing to do so within
24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you need
your card to notify them (and without the card, the hospital certainly

Although I don't want to muddy the waters unnecessarily I disagree. Any
discrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the
sole qualification for religious membership is racial. This is not the
case for Israel although it might get a little closer than, say, Islam.
This of course raises the vexed question of Church AntiSemitism. Jews
have been heavily discriminated against on the grounds of religion in
many Christian countries. If we take Russia as an example Jews were
seriously persecuted but that persecution in the eyes of the Church
and State stopped at the baptismal font. Officially anyway. If a Jew
converted there were no legal barriers in his way (that I know of anyway.)
Peter the Great's Interior Minister came from such a convert background.
Can we then claim that the Russian Orthodox did not teach AntiSemitism
and was not AntiSemitic? Similarly for the Roman Catholic Church? I
suspect so as this is not a racial 'taint' but one based on belief
and AS is after all a form of racism. Well maybe not. What is
AntiSemitism then if not something racially based? I wonder if Hitler
killed converts of 'pure' German blood. Does anyone know one way or
the other?

IMO, a Christian has no need of weapons.  I know it is very contrary to the
American NRA ethos of the right to bear arms, but Christians should rely on
the strength of God to protect them.  Note that I say *should*.  We are
inherently insecure but I feel that that is not proper justification to be
armed to the teeth.  A Christian should not have to rely on physical weapons
to defend himself.  A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence.
For instance, I have the faith that God will protect me but God also gave
me the intelligence to know not to go walking down that dark alley at night.
To jump off a cliff and say that God will save me would be putting God to the
test.  And who are we to test God?

   Yes, Mary is fully human.  However, that does not imply that she was
just as subject to sin as we are.  Catholic doctrine says that man's
nature is good (Gen 1:31), but is damaged by Original Sin (Rom 5:12-16).
In that case, being undamaged by Original Sin, Mary is more fully human
than any of the rest of us.

   You ask why God cannot ""repeat the miracle"" of Mary's preservation
from Original Sin.  A better way to phrase it would be ""why _did_ He
not"" do it that way, but you misunderstand how Mary's salvation was
obtained.  Like ours, the Blessed Virgin Mary's salvation was obtained
through the merits of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross.  However, as
God is not bound by time, which is His creation, God is free to apply
His Sacrifice to anyone at any time, even if that person lived before
Christ came to Earth, from our time-bound perspective.  Therefore,
Christ's Death and Resurrection still served a necessary purpose, and
were necessary even for Mary's salvation.",soc.religion.christian

Has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this

Slower:  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December.  That's less

More Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it

extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.


According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me, there are

Killed by handgun, or killed?  If I'm dead, I don't much care if it
was by being shot or stabbed to death.





I don't think you can get an accurate indicator of how safe England is
compared to Switzerland by concentrating only on handgun murders and  
completely ignoring murders by other weapons, not to mention the rate of
other violent crimes.  If there are more guns in circulation, if follows
that more people will be killed with them 'cause they are available to
the person intent on committing a crime _regardless_ of whether they
have to do it with a gun, knife, or bare hands.  

The gun control lobby doesn't seem to understand this point.  If people
are intent on committing a crime, they will do it with whatever means
are available to them.  ",talk.politics.guns

First I've heard of it. Offhand:

Griffin is no longer an ""office"" head, so that's bad.

On the other hand:

Regress seemed to think: we can't fund anything by Griffin, because
that would mean (and we have the lies by the old hardliners about the
$ 400 billion mars mission to prove it) that we would be buying into a
mission to Mars that would cost 400 billion. Therefore there will be
no Artemis or 20 million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera...

They were killing Griffin's main program simply because some sycophants
somewhere had Congress beleivin that to do so would simply be to buy into
the same old stuff. Sorta like not giving aid to Yeltsin because he's
a communist hardliner.

At least now the sort of reforms Griffin was trying to bring forward
won't be trapped in their own little easily contained and defunded
ghetto. That Griffin is staying in some capacity is very very very
good. And if he brings something up, noone can say ""why don't you go
back to the OSE where you belong"" (and where he couldn't even get money

When I first setup windows using the self load mode It grabbed about
20 megs of swap file space, my 120 meg HD was nearly empty at that time.
I deleted windows for a time and recently reloaded, now my HD is nearly full

I have read somewhere that the best rule of thumb is have your
permanent swap file the same size as your regular RAM size.  I have 4 megs
of RAM and windows took 4 meg perm swap file.  Works very well.
In fact with my available HD space, about 20 megs it won't let me make

Well, I dived in feet first and reverse engineered the .PRJ file as much
as I needed to - extracted the mapping icon information - which is
when it dawned on me that 3D Studio is useless for my needs. I need
a mapping icon per applied texture.  I want to use a special purpose
graphics computer for rendering the 3DS models and it requires a texture
rule/plane to be specified in 3Space, i.e. position/orientation of the
mapping rule.  Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS to apply
textures to ALL objects/faces, it renders (no pun intended) 3DS totally
unsuitable for my needs.

Anyone got a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for a
PC?  I must be able to specify texture rules (one per texture) and this
must be saved in a file which I can read.  I haven't found any info on Alias
in the copy of the faq that I have.",comp.graphics

It is true that Mormons believe that all spirits (including Jesus,
Lucifer, Robert Weiss) are in the same family.  It does not mean
that Jesus was created, but rather that Lucifer and Robert Weiss
were not.  I agree that this is a ""heresy"".  So what?  
The sweating of blood in Gethsemene is
not a basic Mormon doctrine.  Jesus did not perform the atonement
in Getheseme alone, as some anti-Mormons are trying to teach.  
As far as the ""unpardonable sin"" whatever that is, it is Biblical,
and not specifically Mormon.  It is also called the sin against
the Holy Ghost.  Most Bible scholars (other than conservative
ones) do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same.
I'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts?  I don't
know what you mean by ""That He needed to be saved"".  Jesus?
Jehovah?  Elohim?  In Mormon doctrine, Jesus was sinless,
and thus did not ""need to be saved"".

Not to drag this out anymore, but....

Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that
in an endemic area, they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs
presenting with lameness, swollen joints, +/- fever.

A recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs
can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been
an ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements
for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease.
Up to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to ""prove"" that
the disease exists.

This paper is noteworthy in two other regards:

1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs
had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5
months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further
clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So
these are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous
recovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations
longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't
have the same chronicity that some see in humans.

2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the
vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they want
the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine
efficacy.

Anyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluations
of this vaccine in the next year or so.

come in many, many sizes and pinouts), although they do come with 
differing amounts of VRAM on them.  The ones you need are 256KB SIMMs, are

the only size which the Quadra and Centris machines can use.

I'm afraid that I cannot find this portrayal in _EH_. 
I don't see anywhere in 3:32:7-8 where Eusebius mentions that certain

The closest is when Eusebius summarizes Hegesippus' statements,

such 'interpretations.'

And any such 'interpretation' still falls short of an equivalence to 
the Temple Ceremonies. 

The links for Jay's using _EH_ for support are: ""imparting the gift

Or you could replace the stock shifter with a Hurst short-throw
shifter (available from Ford Motorsport), or any number of other

MR-2? With the Detroit aftermarket, you can build a Mustang or
Camaro which is superior to either car you mention for less than
the sticker price of either.


Well, gee. It works, and it doesn't break. It transmits power to
the drive wheels, and it's essentially zero maintenance--and there's
an aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rear-ends, too.


Well, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the
same running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't
speak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too.

Also, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and
always has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the
""pony car"" class came from) with a performance model. That's
why it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored
into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived
his baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet 
accessible--with room for performance tweaking.

The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche,
and they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least,
does well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro.

Yes, he did. He did not publish it, but it will be published by the

Volume 3, due to appear this fall, of his Collected Works.

Meanwhile, you can find a summary, or perhaps the whole thing, in an

do less than this would place these same groups/individuals in

I can only say that those people are wrong. The word harass means to 
irritate or torment persistently; I'd hardly consider one time to fall
under the definition of persistent.  Additionally, there is no basis
to assume the behaviour is unwanted, unlike an illegal proposition.

I was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint.  What you say is true, but
the law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to
make *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted
by the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need
a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there
was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.

The number of people who participate in ""victimless"" crimes notwithstanding,
the fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.  To presume
that the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people
indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in
with a straight face.

Canada's GST is collected as a sales tax and is considered a VAT.
Funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was
never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it,
thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST --- 
one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).

The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down
our deficit.  Unfortunately, their legislation didn't include any
mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and
the money is now sitting in escrow.  I don't know what is involved
in releasing the funds, but one dilemna is that the Tories are not
fiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending,
they've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by
the end of this time --- the end of their second term (~9 years).
While they do have chances of getting a third term, catching up
in the polls to their more moderate/slightly leftish pro-business
rivals, the Liberals (as in Euro/UK), the Tories' heir-apparent 
for the leaders' mantle has been termed a clone of Hillary

Anton LaVey's interpretation of Satanism has always puzzled me.  I
read his ""Satanic Bible"" a few years ago for a social studies project,
as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called ""The Cult of Devil Worship
in America.""  The latter included a very interesting interview with
the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an
instrument for one to realize the self.  

When I refer to Satanism, I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic
ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan.  I
don't consider LaVey's church to be at all ""orthodox,"" nor do I consider
its followers ""satanists.""  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche,
Crowley, and Reich, slapped in some religious doctrine, added a little
touch of P.T. Barnum, and christened his creation the Church of Satan.
No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...I
suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex.

At any rate, it worked (for a while).  In its heyday, the Church had a
huge following, including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis, Jr.
and Jayne Mansfield.  (I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy, by the 
way.)  

I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as
a Christian not believing in Christ.  But if you include the Church of
Satan, then I suppose I need to alter my definition.  Webster's Dictionary
and The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same.",alt.atheism

I am told (by the person who I care a lot about and who I am worried

available on the National Health Service and that there are about 6000
GPs who use homeopathic practices. True? False? What?

Have there been any important and documented investigations into
homeopathic principles?

I was reading a book on homeopathy over the weekend. I turned to the
section on the principles behind homeopathic medicine, and two
paragraphs informed me that homeopaths don't feel obliged to provide
any sort of explanation. The author stated this with pride, as though
it were some sort of virtue! Why am I sceptical about homeopathy? Is
it because I am a narrow-minded bigot, or is it because homeopathy

One should be aware that foreign doctors admitted for training
are ineligible to apply for resident alien status.  In order
to get the green card they have to return to their country and
apply at the embassy there.  Of course, many somehow get around
this problem.  Often it is by agreeing to practice in a town
with a need and then the congressman from that district tacks
a rider onto a bill saying ""Dr. X will be allowed to have permanent
residency in the US.""  A lot of bills in congress have such riders
attached to them.  Marrying a US citizen is the most common, although

I have currently a Kryptonite Rock Lock through the front wheel, a HD

Next Friday the 30th I have an appointment to have an alarm installed on

When I travel the Cobra Links and the cover and padlock stay at home.

By the way. I also removed the plastic mesh that is on the Cobra Links
and encased the lock from end to end using bicycle inner tubes (two of
them) I got the from bicycle dealer that sold me the Cobra Links. The
guys were really great and didn't mark up the price of the lock much

My point is that ""if life has meaning or importance then we should try

the search.

If you want ""meaning"" why not search for the truth?

But this gives another avenue of attack on the Clipper proposal.  When

likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum

I don't think that this is accurate. I believe, and could be wrong, that
there IS a specific right allegedly to have been violated, like the
14th or due process or whatever.


Double jeopardy does not apply, but not for the reasons you quote. Double
jeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge.
However, the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive force
or assault. They are NOW on trial for the DIFFERENT crime of violating
Mr. King's civil rights. 

AS for the city and county or state trying you more than once, 
it most likely will not happen. This is because cities and states
have separate laws governing behaviour. For example, in some states,
it is an offence to carry marijuana, but not a city offence. Also,
I think murder is against federal, but not some state laws. ",talk.politics.misc
"[ . . .]

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you
phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of ""right""
and ""wrong"" (or ""correct/incorrect"" or ""true/false"") belong to the
domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no
sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is
legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).

Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives
of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.
One can certainly ask if a percept is ""right"" (correct, true,
veridical) or ""wrong"" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little
sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is
strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can
certainly ask that question about motives.

Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered:
they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.

Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with
the first part (that the ""rightness"" of a moral position is a
meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is
irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that
one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make
value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the ""correctness""
of the position.

Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is
that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,
neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold
different moral values (feelings).",alt.atheism

: 

	New CARBS??? Why would that fix it? you still have to get the 
jetting right to match what seems to be a extremely overly lean condition.
You added a more free flowing exhaust, and then higher flowing filters. 
Chances are it's to lean. BUT! This may not be,that's the big fun with 
carb tuning. It's _very_ tricky. 

	Your one and only choice (unless you want to spend many hours
fiddling with the carbs) is to take it to a guy witha  Dyno and have he
tune the carbs for your current set up. Otherwise you'll be playing
a guessing game for a long time...

	Then let me ask you for a ""workable"" solution.  We have a name
here that implies certain things to many people.  Rather than trying
to educate each and every person that comes to the group -- is there
some ""name"" that would imply what this group was originally
intended for?  

	My dad was a lawyer -- as such I grew up with being a stickler
for ""meaning"".  In my ""reality"", psychoactives *technically* could 
range from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more
standard recreational drugs.  In practice I had hoped to see it
limited to those that were above some psychoactive level -- like
some of the drugs you mention, but also possibly including *some*
recreational drugs -- but with conversation limited to their psychoactive 
effects -- the recent query about ""bong water"", I thought was a bit
off topic -- so I just hit ""k"".

	But back to the original question -- what is a workable solution --
what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to
discuss?  It sounds like there should be a alt.smartdrugs, or something
similar -- I don't feel psychoactives would generally be used to
describe alot of those drugs.  There is a big difference between a
drug that if taken in ""certain doses, over a period of days may have
a psychoactive effect in some people"", vs. many of the drugs in
PIHKAH which *are* psychoactive.

"Hi,

I'm trying to get my program to monitor resize/position events,
so that when the program exits, I can save the last known geometry in 
some sort of 'preferences' file.

I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell:

 XtAddEventHandler(topLevel,StructureNotifyMask,False,configureCB,myData);

This works fine, and my callback is called whenever the window is resized
or repositioned using the window manager (mwm).

However, when I'm just resizing the window, using any resize handle on the
window manager resize decoration, the x and y are set to zero in the
XEvent passed to the event handler callback.  I'm accessing the xconfigure
structure, like the X11 manual says.  (xev->xconfigure.x, xev->xconfigure.y).
The width and height memebers are correct.

When I reposition the window, using the window manager, the xevent's xconfigure
structure contains all the correct x, y, width, height member settings.

Q1: Anybody know why, when just resizing, the x and y are being set to zero?

Q2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes?

I've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting my
application (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage values
for the x, y, width, height resources.

Thanks

"hello,

I just want to make 2 points:

1) The FBI is not stupid. These people are chosen for their intelligence,
education, loyalty to the government, etc. They are given much intensive
training. So, to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any
conspiracy here, and say that the FBI was just stupid, I say I don't
believe it.

2) The FBI has acces to the latest in audio and video technology -- the
latest digital systems. The FBI can manufacture evidence. Need a tape of
Koresh saying, ""light the fire"", and you can have one. Need a thermal
imaging video of three people lighting fires, and through the magic of
computer graphics, you can have one. The thing is, manufacturing these
pieces of evidence takes time. So it may be a few more days before we
get to see them. Or maybe we just haven't heard any tapes or seen any
FBI video is because it is:
	1) classified
	2) too gruesome for our eyes
	3) lost/got coffee spilled on it

Well, let me put it this way, based on my own experience.  A
general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases,
by establishing links to the ""Lyme community"", treating patients
who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they
have lyme as if they did, saying that diseases such as MS
are probably spirochetal, if not Lyme, giving talks at meetings
of users groups, validating the feelings of even delusional
patients, etc.  This GP can go from being a run-of-the-mill
$100K/yr GP to someone with lots of patients in the hospital
and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his
office, and making lots of bread.  Also getting the adulation
of many who believe his is their only hope (if not of cure,
then of control) and seeing his name in publications put out
by support groups, etc.  This is a definite temptation.

"Ever since the siege at Waco started the FBI spokesman has been
stressing how unstable and paranoid David Koresh was.  He stressed how
likely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  He
was concerned with the safety of the children.
 
What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassure
Koresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI
offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the
permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?
 
What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible.
They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their
electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears
with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept
limiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on
David Koresh.
 
Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping
to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack
the the tanks.
 
It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over
the edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the
federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools
at the ATF who planed the raid.
 
Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have
resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people.
 
If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today.
Instead the ATF screwed up and caused the death of 90+.  Incompetent

Yes, but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize
Christianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think
the motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their

And actually, I think that the government already does recognize that

Don't you realize/recognize this?

This isn't to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings of
Christianity, just that most people do.

No, but I hear quite a bit about Christmas, and little if anything about
Jesus.  Wouldn't this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really
associated to a high degree with him?  Or are you saying that the
association with Jesus is on a personal level, and that everyone thinks
about it but just never talks about it?

Whether there is a ""why"" or not we have to find it. This is Pascal's(?) wager.
If there is no why and we spend our lives searching, then we have merely
wasted our lives, which were meaningless anyway. If there is a why and we
don't search for it, then we have wasted our potentially meaningful lives.
Suppose the universe is 5 billion years old, and suppose it lasts another
5 billion years. Suppose I live to be 100. That is nothing, that is so small
that it is scary. So by searching for the ""why"" along with my friends here
on earth if nothing else we aren't so scared.

"As per various threads on science and creationism, I've started dabbling into a
book called Christianity and the Nature of Science by JP Moreland.  A question
that I had come from one of his comments.  He stated that God is not 
necessarily a religious term, but could be used as other scientific terms that
give explanation for events or theories, without being a proven scientific 
fact.  I think I got his point -- I can quote the section if I'm being vague. 
The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates.  Are there 
explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of
themselves, or can everything be quantified, measured, tested, etc.?

"[much discussion about switching 5.25"" and 3.5"" drives removed]

Another (albeit strange) option is using a program like 800 II
(available via anonymous FTP at many major sites), or FDFORMAT
(also available via anonymous FTP), that allows you to format
5.25HD disks to 1.44Meg, or 3.5""HD disks to 1.2Meg (along with
many MANY other formats!) so you can DISKCOPY (yes, the broken
MeSsy-DOS DISKCOPY!) the 5.25"" disks onto 3.5"" disks or vice
versa...  I use this techniques with ""NON-DOS"" self-booting 
game disks on my old Tandy 1000, and it works...  Another program
named Teledisk (shareware--available on many major BBS's) will
also make the weird format disks, provided you have 800 II
or FDFormat installed....  Some disks that won't DISKCOPY
properly can be readily Teledisk'd into the proper format...
At least this is a software solution for a hardware/BIOS

"  Correct. Most X servers use a version of  malloc(3)  which will not return
  memory to the OS (ie. the X server might  free(3)  a Pixmap, but the heap does
  not shrink).

  Well, part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around
  that problem. First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,
  attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man
  pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment
  only dies after all attachments are gone.
  Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)
  and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,
  including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more
  shared memory segment.
  Terrible, but it works.

I think you must have the same hygiene teacher I had in 1955.  There 
is a story about the Civil War about a soldier who was shot in the
groin.  The bullet, after passing through one of his testes, then entered
the abdomen of a young woman standing nearby.  Later,  when she (a young
woman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier did
the honorable thing of marrying her.  According to this story, they lived
happily ever after.  
Perhaps the most famous of Mr. Rau's classes was the time he would come
into class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel  (tapering from about
3/8"" to 1/2"" over a 10 inch length).  He would say, ""Boys, do you know
what this is?  It's a medical instrument called a 'cock reamer' and it's
used to unclog your penis when you have VD.  They just ram it up there
without an anesthetic!""  Needless to say this had a chilling effect.
I didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour.  Later in life
as I perused medical instrument catelogs and saw the slender flexible
urethral sounds that are actually used, I could not escape thinking
that I might one day see, ""Reamer, Cock (style of Rau) .""

While that is currently true from their perspective, it is also
worthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer
from attempts to control the guerillas.  Furthermore, there were
cases in the past of Palestinian gun emplacements being situated
within villages.  The argument that can be made for small arms
fire can not be made for field pieces.


As I recall, Amal was primarily nationalistically ""Lebanon for
the Lebanese"" motivated.  I think that the difference between them
was also a matter of funding and support.  One question does
come to mind however, 

Given that you claim the Hizbollah to be more committed etc... and
that their stated position is:
	1.  No peace talks.
	2.  No peace talks.
	.
	.
	.
	.
	N-1. No peace talks.
	N.  No Israel

if we assume that Lebanon and Syria are sincere in their desire for
peace, why hasn't the Hizbollah been disarmed?


Bearing in mind the above and that military losses are more palatable
than civilian ones, I am sure you can understand why Israel is slow
to act in that manner.


I agree that Syria wants Lebanon to be part of its greater Syria.
I don't necessarily see that the Syrians would be unhappy to see
Israel up to its neck in another Lebanese morass afterwhich Syria
could continue on its merry schedule when Israeli public opinion
would lead to a second pullout.

Well, let me see if I can explain it.  It's similar to collecting coins,
or stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or model
trains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just about
everything is collected).  In all cases, you might consider it something
of an aberration; I mean, what purpose does it serve?  Not much really;
it's just a hobby.  The collector yearns for diversity (not much use in
having TWO of the same thing, except for trading/selling it), historical
significance (this was the thingy used by so-and-so), technical significance
(this is the only one that does such-and-such like this; this is the first
one to do it this way), rarity, and so on.

Some people use their collections, other people do not.  As you state, you
use your collection.  In one sense, this diminishes the value of your
collection as the items suffer wear and exposure.  In another sense, it
can enhance your own enjoyment of your collection.  Some people collect
firearms that they do not use; other people use some or all of the firearms
they collect.  It's just personal preference.

I looked back at this, and asked some questions of various people and
got the following information which I had claimed and you pooh-poohed.
The US has not sold Iraq any arms.  Their navy is entirely made of
F-USSR vessels.  Their airforce (not including stuff captured from Kuwait
which I am not as sure about), doesn't include any US equipment.  Their
missiles are all non-US.  Their tanks are almost all soviet, with about
100 French tanks (older ones). The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal
is a few M113s.  Those were not sold to Iraq.  Iraq captured them from
other countries (like Kuwait).  Information is hard to prove.  You are
claiming that the US sold information?  Prove it. 

Now, how did the US build up Iraq again?  I just gave some fairly
conclusive evidence that the US didn't sell arms to Iraq.  Information
is hard to prove, almost certainly if the US did sell information, then that
fact is classified, and you can't prove it.  If you can provide some
useful evidence that the US sold arms or valuable intelligence to Iraq,
I am very interested, but not if you just make claims based on what

have all (korea continues) reverse-engineered foreign chips and
produced the chip.  Taiwan and Japan have signed intellectual
property treaties, and now at least extract the gate/transitor level
design before laying the chip out again.  The koreans still
use mask-level copying, I believe.  At least, they are under a lot
of pressure to pass laws to meet international intellectual property
standards.

All this despite lots of attempts to hide the designs.  There are lots
of techniques to do so in both hardware and software design.

For a complex chip, there will be real intellectual effort extracting
the gate design from the transistor design, and the algorithm from
the gate design.  But it won't take two smart guys even 6 months, working
40 hour weeks.  Koreans work 60 or more 8)

"This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a
way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit)
to get the usual 8?  My case has slots for 8, and I'd like to
get a scanner, but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out!
I'm hoping that a simple solution exists, e.g. an adapter that turns
one slot into three.  I don't mind if it turns it into 8-bit slots,
as I can put my I/O card, MIDI card, and Soundblaster card there.
My other cards are 16 bit (IDE/Floppy, SVGA, modem).

I too am a Jules Verne collector, and can tell you that though tough 
to find, it *is* out there.  I keep my eyes open all the time for his
books at various Bay Area used book stores, and every once in a while
get *very* lucky.  You just need diligence.  I don't know if the book
store situation near JSC is as good as the Bay Area, but good luck.
I have also had excellent luck at the Antiquarian Book Fair which comes
to SF every other year, though the prices are more in the $100-$200 range
than the $50 you want to spend.  My guess is that *if* you find it,
you won't need to spend even that much, since most people don't care 
about it.  I think I paid about $15 for my dust-jacket-less but otherwise
good condition copy, which I found one day at a small bookshop that happened
to have just bought a lot of random books at an estate sale.  

Of course, if you re willing to buy blind, you can put a $2 advertisement
in the Antiquarian Bookseller's newsletter (the exact title of which escapes
me at the moment.)  _Five Weeks in a Balloon_ is not the rarest of Jules
Verne books.  Someone has it for sale somewhere, and the AB is the way to 
find it.  In fact, I would be surprised if you didn't get multiple offers
of sale.  Of course, that takes the fun out of hunting for it yourself...

Simple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be
some confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use
the same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it
is not possible to have both cards active at the same time.

Here is an example.  For some time, I was short of ""free interrupts.""  I had a
tape controller (not a ""floppy tape"") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an
*old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my
modem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and
the tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt
handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate
an interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape
controller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would
most likely ""hang."")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it
installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for
the serial port.

Under DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the
status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.
That's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7.
Try that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-)

"You want to speed up ballgames?

1.  Enforce the two minutes between innings.  As it is, many fields are
    allowing THREE minutes between them.  Fifteen seconds before 
    TV commercials are gone to, Thirty or so before action begins upon
    the return to the game.  Two minutes, last out to first pitch, or
    a ball is called.

2.  Don't grant time to batters just because they want it.  They may get
    pissed at first, but they'll get in line, once anything the pitcher
    throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike.

3.  Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches (the current
    rule is too lenient), and then enforce it.  Fifteen seconds is more
    than enough time.  If the pitch isn't released in 15, call it a ball,
    and restart the clock.

in the AL.  That's just too damn long.  I don't like to PLAY in 3 hour

If I understand your problem correctly, you want to have a way to send
exposures to your manager widget when your app-specific code draws xlib
graphics on the window.

It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using
XSendEvent and specifying a region. If you know the region you need to
send the exposure, generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects,
you can use XCreateRegion to create a region, XUnionRectWithRegion to add the
new object polygons to the region, and then either use the region
to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your
other objects need to be redrawn. Keeping in mind that the stacking order
of overlapping objects affects how they look.

Hope it helps

My interpretation of Denning's description is that S1 and S2 are chosen
randomly by agents of the key escrow companies at the start of each 300-
chip programming session.  I imagine that the chips are in a carrier which
will allow them all to be programmed fairly quickly - there would not be
a need to transfer chips one at a time into a little PLA programmer as some
people have envisioned.

My guess as to why this procedure is used is that basing the keys on the
S1 and S2 using a specified algorithm provides an (in-principle) checkable
way to verify that no back doors exist in the choice of the random numbers
used to generate the keys.  Since we have to trust the escrow companies
anyway, it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from
random seeds entered by the escrow agents.  And since the algorithm for
key-generation is public (modulo Skipjack secrecy) then in principle an
agent could challenge the procedure, ask for S1 and S2 to be exposed, and
run his own independent calculation of U1 and U2 to verify that that is
what is actually being put onto the floppies.

And yes, there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could
be hard to check.  The laptop probably will not really be destroyed each
time.  Hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the S1 and S2 entered by
the trusted escrow agents.  Back doors in the chip could allow U to be
recovered.  Heck, each chip could be recorded with the same U, ignoring
what was on the floppy.",sci.crypt

Good point, Brett.  It might merely be proof that basic health care
markets operate differently, with certain nonmarket phenomenom that
the private sector can't handle well (like armies vs. warlords). In
that respect, the effects on American society vs. Canadian/European
society might also be different.


Good point again.  Blue Cross in the U.S. is quite convoluted compared
to the Canadian and German insurance funds, which have a minimal
organization to coordinate it.  If anything, bureaucracy now needs to
be built up in Canada to combat fraud, such as Americans crossing the
border individually to use insurance cards borrowed from friends and
relatives or using phony domestic addresses, or fraud rings stealing
them in blocks.  Our private practices are now recording insurance
account numbers, both public insurance and private insurance, which
most have never bothered to do before on assumption of an honour 
system.

Hi everyone,
           I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a problem.  I know
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying' You fools,
do you still think that just believing is enough?'

Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves
and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.
But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to
him (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who
knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.

Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do)
as taught in Romans, but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James
in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spat-out'

Can anyone help me, this really bothers me.-- 

in Christ,

Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the
end.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and
others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations
cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be
disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2
boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be
disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the ""experts"".

Well, it's not that simple -- you're in Earth's magnetic field, and you
don't generate electricity -- but it can be done.


The way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first
question is definitely yes.  (If you meant to say ""propel"" rather than
""power"", the answer is ""sort of"".)  Yes, you can use interaction with the
Earth's magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential
applications for this.

However, bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn't
coming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy
of your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where
this is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion
is useful only in special situations, however.

What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays,
and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy
*into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.

If you want more information, trying looking up ""electrodynamic propulsion"",
""tether applications"", and ""magsails"".

"        I had to turn to one of my problem sets that I did in class for this
little problem.  I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set that
we did not too long ago, so I'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted.  
This is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts are
usually more complex than this example I will use here.
        Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration
of 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds,
its flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the
time.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.
        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several
different spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the
galaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a
R=8800Mpc.  
        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the
old standby formula:
                        Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak
        For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty
energetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.
And lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call
moderately energetic, I'd say.  Any suggestions about what could put out that
much energy in one second?

And another survivor claims he heard someone shouting ""The fire's started!"".
Odd terminology.  That's what one says when you know a fire is planned, not 
when one occurs by accident.  We will have to wait and see what the evidence 
shows, assuming one is willing to believe any evidence offered by the 
""distrustful ones"".


Neither.  Again I was merely addressing the sanity level of the players.  
I agree that the BATF handled the affair badly from day one.  BTW, I heard 
on the news today that the affadavit behind the no-knock warrant was unsealed 
today.  Grenade launcher was the only thing on the list that I found 
unusual.


Ambitious news reporters could use the documentary filmed by an Australian 
in 1992 on the compound grounds to help identify survivors.  I, for one, 
will check their stories for consistency with what I learned in a long 
news story about that documentary.


Certainly there is some room for doubt.  I certainly reserve the right 
to change my opinions when new evidence warrants such a change.  If I 
were conspiratorially minded, however, I would never be able to change 
my mind, because any evidence I disliked would have to be a lie 
fabricated by the ""distrustful ones"".

Hi Brad,

I have two comments:  Regarding your hope that the ""occupation will end... 
belive that stiff resistance..etc. - how about an untried approach, i.e.,
peace and cooperation.  I can't help but wonder what would happen if all
violence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabs
would stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be 
maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e.,
greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the
""territories"".  

Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work
also - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel
Sharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life,
i.e., no winners.

Secondly, regarding your comment about the U.S. troops responding
to ""stiff resistance"" - the analogy is not quite valid.  The U.S.
troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.  The Israelis
could not.

Just my $.02 worth, no offense intended.

This suggestion isn't as far-fetched as it sounds.  Years ago in another
time and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive
engines.  In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under
the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various
floation chambers on each side.  And if you *did* get something there, you'd
spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.

So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out
the dipstick hole.  There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed
to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the
outlet side that you put into any convenient container.  I'm sure these

KINDness and LOVE?

2. Is the fact the He no longer does this an admission on His part of
having made a mistake?

3. Now that we are ""living in the age of grace"", does this mean that
for our sins, God now damns us to eternal hell after we die, rather
than killing us immediately?  If so, is this eternal damnation an
example of ""A KIND and LOVING God!!""?

Me too, though unfortunately the ""Official Line"" is the one that you
have to adhere to if you want to get a full licence. The examiner's
guidelines are laid down by the government, and the basic rider education
courses have no choice but to follow them. It surprises me that none of the
rider groups here, either MAG or the BMF make much noise about the fact that
the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time
in order to pass, that the front brake must be applied before the rear, that
you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time (instead of just
when it is justified) - there's probably a few more too, which I can't
think of for the moment. If the riding test could be rejigged a bit

It might be interesting for folk to know that the Church of Scotland
(also a Presbyterian church)  managed to ""agree to disagree"" over
women's ordination for 25 years.  The reasoning was that congregations
are free to call whoever they wish, and that Ministers and Sessions
choose elders.  If a congregation did not wish to have a woman, they
were not obliged to, and if a Session did not wish to, they could not
be forced to.  (Note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part
of the Congregation is VERY important here - this year is the 150th
Annivarsary of the Disruption, where the church split on that very
issue, they didn't get back together for almost 80 years).

A couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womens
ordination the position was changed - so that, in theory, all
ministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained.  In
theory, a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his Session, or
refused to work with a woman minister in Presbytery, could be
disciplined.  In practice this has not happened, and I believe it is
unlikely to happen.  My personal view is that the new legislation was
a mistake, and that the permissive (but not prescriptive) legislation
worked very well.  

We are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years
assembly.  At this years, a motion was put to ban the blessing of
same-sex couples (after an Edinburgh minister did so).  Our Panel on

the matter will be considered and debated then.

they don't have enough prison space, and the legal system is over-

"(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered)

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item
to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() 
(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles
""regular"" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care
of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a ""proper"" way
to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is
guaranteed to be mapped.

The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window
is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow ""tickle"" the
Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable
it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.",comp.windows.x

Comparing the GTZ and GSR is apples to oranges, somewhat like a Mustang 5.0
and a CRX, both have very different ways of doing things and ought to
appeal to different buyers, i.e., I don't think an Acura owner would
be seen dead in a Chevy dealership or vice versa.

[stuff deleted]


No Integra I have seen comes with all-season tires. 
The GTZ does come with much bigger 16"" wheels.


The C+D figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype
supplied by Acura. The MT figures are more plausible.

16.1 sounds reasonable, probably faster than regular Integras.


The GSR gearing is horrible for day to day driving. It needs a 6 speed
box more than any other modern car. Essentially 5th in a regualr Integra
equals 4th in the GSR, and the regular Integras are very buzzy at speed.


The only person I knew with a GTZ had it bought back by GM as a lemon. It
was a piecve of junk, but very quick for FWD.


The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than 5k
miles, a rare screw up by Honda.
Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars. The performance enthusiasts would take
the GTZ and the CR purchase would be the GSR.

"My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding
jacket.  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would
like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.

I'm considering two basic options:

1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs
    due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.
    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact
    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates
    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.

2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new 
    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey
    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather
    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose
    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper
    than upper Aerostich.

Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other 
layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out 
lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, 
shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a 
reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would 
be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below
freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

Are you sure about this? I'm currently looking at a copy of last 
Thursday's SF Chronicle and there is the typical one column Traders

a part in the middle which rather prominently says ""WANTED: We pay
cash for assault rifles and pistols."". Granted, I haven't seen today's
paper yet. But I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Traders ad in it.
It's probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers)

The April 1993 edition of MIX Magazine carries a story on 3DO which
includes pictures of the unit, a schematic of what's inside and some
indication from the people at 3DO as to where they intend to go and in
what stages. (MIX is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound
engineering community.)

The schematic shows a central DMA Engine connecting and mediating between
two Graphics Animation processors (32 bit bus), a 32-bit RISC processor
with math co-processor, Video Decomp module, a control port, an expansion
port (where 3DO hangs its double-fast CD player), 1Mb DRAM, an optional
video port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1MB VRAM to Video
Processor to TV chain parallel with a DSP to sound chain. 

They promise Red Book CD-quality audio, full 30 fps video and a future
connection path to your PC via a PC expansion card.

I am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and
methods discussed here. The article, written by Philip De Lancie, does
cover the other machines mentioned in this thread.  I come from the PC
TCP/IP world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to
the educated consumer; 3DO seems to have the right business partners to
make this happen.

Here's the point. If the Davidians had their propane tanks hooked

ruptured the lines. Which then would start spreading out through
the overhead. And since it was a country home, it wasn't necessarily

It's probably more plausible than anything else, that the fire started
mainly as a result of accident -- or willful negligence on the part of

It's certain that if the tanks hadn't been used that day -- the fire

Kaufman,
I think we have a problem in this newsgroup: every time somebody puts
down serious questions on Israel, the first response would be ""what about
the Arab countries?"" ...

Most of the Arab countries governments are ruling their people with Iron
fist policy and Dark Ages democracy (if exists). Ironically, these are 
the countries that the ""West"" would like to deal with and would wage 
massive wars to protect them and their resources.

For Israel the situation is different, Israel claims it is a
democracy -- I would call it selective democracy, that abides by Western
democratic standards. If Israel is saying that then
it has to be compared to Western standards. If this comparison is the
advertized propaganda from Israel, then we have to look at seriously at
question that can and should be asked regarding any country advertizing
this standard. 
That is very incorrect, I see you have been brain-washed well, I would

Pardon me Tim, but I do not see how it can be possible for the IDF to fail
to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which
killed the three IDF troops and then later know the exact number and 
whereabouts of all of them. Several villages were shelled. How could the IDF
possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted
villages? You see, it was an arbitrary act of ""retaliation"".



The problem, Tim, is that the original reason for the invasion was Palestinian
attacks on Israel, NOT Lebanese attacks. 


First, I believe that my statement applies to both sides.

Having said that, I think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately
negotiable and what is not. For example, no country has the right to abuse
one's human rights. Deciding whether there will be one or two states in
Palestine is a legitimate question. While de facto one state exists, Israel 
must treat all within its domain equitably.


Yes, I am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify
occupying your neighbor's land. Israel must resolve its disputes with the
native Palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks.


Not true. Lebanese were not attacking Israel in the 1970s. With a strong
Lebanese government (free from Syrian and Israeli interference) I believe
that the border could be adequately patrolled. The Palestinian heavy
weapons have been siezed in past years and I do not see as significant a
threat as once existed.",talk.politics.mideast

As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  ""multi-headed""
tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even
multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg,
a Sun with a cg4 display).  ""multi-screen"" and ""multi-display"" would,
if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning
of ""multi-display"" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing
""multi-screen"" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.

""zaphod"" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the
pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
screen.


There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at
most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays
on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can
be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a
limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation
inherent to X.

What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit
of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing
about X.

	Hmmm.  ""Check your facts.""  Good advice.  Let's check Mr. Cain's
facts a bit, shall we?



FACT:  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license
to do so from PKP, whether or not one is charging for it.  Furthermore,
any use of RSA, other than for research purposes allowed under US patent
law, is similarly unlawful.  Therefore, the ""average citizen"" cannot use
RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.

There is no licensed, freely available product in the US that uses RSA
encryption other than RSAREF (and hence RIPEM), at least as far as I am
aware.  If you know of another, please post it here.


FACT:  The last contact I had with RSA Data Security, Inc was with some
guy trying to sell me a license (unsolicited, I might add) for TIPEM.
Cost: $15K plus 2-5 percent royalties.

I suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count
as ""mucho bucks"" or ""incredibly reasonable.""  Either way, however, this
definitely falls into the ""routines *they* tell you to (use)"".


FACT:  There are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under
US law, although this is beginning to look like it will change.  The only
impediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKP's
patents.

hatred, spend all their time attacking Judaism, Jews, and Israel,
using the most despicable of anti-Semetic stereotypes?

	I don't think we need to coin a term like ""Jedeo-Nazism"" to
refer to those Jews who, in their endless desire to be accepted by the
Nazis, do their dirty work for them.  We can just call them house
Jews, fools, or anti-Semites from Jewish families.

	I think ""house Jews,"" a reference to a person of Jewish

That is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live. 
If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to
get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your
vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any
thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:

1)	ignition kill or fuel cut-off
2)	a flashing red LED

These two are basic to a decent alarm system.  
To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock.
That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target.

But it is subject to all kinds of bias, and is almost completely useless
for first basemen.  From the raw stats, there is no way to tell which of
a first baseman's putouts were made on throws from other fielders, and
which were made on his own plays; likewise, you can't tell whether a
double play was 6-4-3 or 3-6-3.  Fielding Runs thus gives a first
baseman no credit for putouts or double plays, only for assists and
errors.  

It thus favors first basemen who play deep, reaching a lot of balls but
forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently.  It also hurts first
baseman who play behind left-handed pitching staffs and thus face few
left-handed batters.


This is better; of course, it still isn't all of a first baseman's
defense.


Defensive Average, which uses larger (and probably better) zones, has
Mattingly tied for second in the league.

One performance reason comes to mind: if you jettison the SSME's, you

that you can't use them for re-boost or anything else.  Dead weight has
a couple of advantages, but more disadvantages.

Throw-away SSME's might let us use some of the old SSME's which are not-

I'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However, I don't know anyone who has
one.  I have my eye on two choices.

Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks
software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software
Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.

Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales
(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169
mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.

I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It
is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400
dpi) and price ($149).  

Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that
Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the
best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP
LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the
Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of
prices.  Which should I buy?

If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would

  You haven't fully explained the atheist position.  Many theists believe that

of the scientific method--for example:

  The physical laws of the universe are stable.

  Objective reality exists.
  Logical argument is a valid way to answer all questions.

are not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictions
that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the same
for Golan Heights) back to the Arabs. An 18 months of ""negotiations"" in Madrid,
and Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying why
are you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations.
I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations, what do they have to
loose ?

driver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI
accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life 
of one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by
motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the
insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public
against those of us who ride responsibly.

In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence.

It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks...

The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices
it is attached when it wants to.

An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the
SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to
start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the
bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are
ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.

On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked
the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other
processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.

you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees
with you is amoral.

I'd say that compromise seems to be ""better"".

Scrap the Seawolf SSN-21 nuclear submarine. The breakup of the USSR has
left us with a number of sticky military problems, but NONE of them will
require ""God's gift to submarines"". 

Ground the B-2 stealth bomber. I'm sure it's a great airplane that will do

DMorf (Dave's Morph, I think is what it means) and DTax (Dave's

on the wuarchive.

They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions,
dmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe
there, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or
dtax.exe.

I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing

figure out the tricks.

without using the splines option.  Not sure why, since I don't have
the source.  I think it was written for TP 6.0.

    Hi,
      I've been using Plannet Crafter's ""Plug-in"" for Program Manager.
      Its listed in most BBS'es as PLUGIN13.  Its an add-on which gives
      some needed features to Progman; such as the ability to better
      manage your groups, change your cursor and icons on the fly,
      constant status of RAM and resources, ""Quick-menu"" (a drop-down
      menu of DOS commands or app launcher), plus some other neat stuff.
      Used it, liked it, and even reg'd it <G>.

      If you can't find it anywhere, let me know and I'll zip it up and
      mail it to you (shareware version, of course <g>...)

Terry, hi.  I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E.  I can't
remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me
a strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable
all extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using
the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.
The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked
the dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell
me if it works.

I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for
inspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they
have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the
inspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the
keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info
from them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them
the keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer service
lines are toll calls. Tell me if you have a similar experience.

"They don't have a conflict because technically LPT1: does not use
IRQ7!.
     The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes
me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip
to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7,
then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel
printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore
no Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip,
thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.

     Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do not
route interrupts to the system bus, although COM's software
usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port
activity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probably
getting the sound card slighty confused!.",comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

Jim,

I think you must have come in late. The discussion (on my part at
least) began with Benedikt's questioning of the historical acuuracy of
the NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to
validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history,
then virtually nothing is known of the first century.

You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it
speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact. Your objection
has nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of
atheism.",alt.atheism

Can anybody point me at a utility which will read/convert/crop/whatnot/

Well, they claim they are the only radio broadcaster with this
information.  But the city's cable channel (35 in CableVision areas)
shows this information map during travel times (6-9am and 4-7pm, I
believe).  Most of the major LA freeways are covered.  The
computer-generated map shows green, yellow, red, or flashing red
(respectively: <40mph, 25-40mph, >25mph, and ""incident""--I might be off
a little on the speeds, since this is from memory).

I often look at this display in the morning to see if I really want to
fight the traffic on the Sepulveda Pass or work from home for a little
while to wait for it to clear.

Another poster explained the origin of the information: sensors (embedded
wire loops) in the pavement near ramps and every half mile or so.  CalTrans
has had a ""big board"" driven from this data in their traffic control center
for some time.  I don't know if they are selling the data or if anyone
with the equipment necessary for its transmission and display can have
it.",sci.electronics

Well, I never wrote that I would act as you described.  I stated that I 
would not block a would-be passer.  I would not block a would-be passer
""for their own good"" or for any reason other than I was prevented from 
doing so due to the traffic circumstance.  I fail to see how deterring a
passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances
of being involved in an accident, fatal or otherwise.  In fact, I could
imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your 
chances of being ""offed"" or involved in an accident, especially if 
this ""passer"" is riding your bumper.  Intentionally blocking a person
riding your bumper is certainly NOT a ""wise driving practice"", it 
only causes the jam to become more congested. 
 
I don't mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the 
road behind!   If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a ""pack"" 
of vehicles, I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you 
decribe.  Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal 
with this fact of life, or I wait to a slow passer to complete their 
pass and make way for the pack to clear.  If someone decides then to 
pull up on my bumper, I signal my intention to move to the right, and 
do so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam).  I 
feel this is not only courteous driving, but ALOT safer than the 
actions you advocate!!!  There are actually many courteous drivers 
on the road who do not intentionally impede others.  ",rec.autos

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger
economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste*
on a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, 
but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military,
scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a ""we have 
the money, why not?"" approach.

It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose, it's possible
that Luna will have a commercial purpose, but it's most likely that
Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred
years at least. Therefore, Lunar bases should be predicated on funding
levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases. Can you

I think your ideas are well taken and constructive.  Thanks for
articulating them in this forum.


As a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist (:-), I'at a loss for
specific objections that don't sound frighteningly technical.  Any
suggestions?  Perhaps somebody could post a list of these?

 
One way to do this might be to suggest that these companies should be
implementing their own schemes, not being limited to the govt's
scheme.

I find that most of my reasons for opposition to the CLipper scheme
are algoritm insecurity and mistrust of the govt/NSA.  These are hard 
to sell in letters to the editor and to nontechnical people.  Any
hints or advice.  Maybe a small FAQ-type thing ""Why should I Hate
Clipper"" would be a good idea.",sci.crypt

"And why is this Freeman?  Even if a pro-gun person doesn't know what they are
talking about there is always the possibility that they will learn a thing or
two.  I am and will continue to post even if people get angry with what I have

Ah, Freeman seems to forget from my statement that I am learning.  I have also

Another good habit to get into is to realize that not everyone is you Freeman

misinformation being slung by some anti-gun nut but it wasn't.  I made my
statement to inform everyone of this and everyone who replied said don't worry

gave me sources of information and told me to read as much as possible.  I have
read several posts of yours and have found them informative.  Why don't you

Actually, the record of the Allies activities, in the face of
incontrovertible evidence as to what the Nazis (may they rot in hell)
were doing, clearly points to the conclusion that they would have done
nothing.  The railways to the camps were not bombed, despite the ease
of doing so.  The US, the ""place of refuge"" allowed in a bare pittance
of Jews from Europe, primarily for public relations, so that the
government could say it was ""doing something"".  Many ships with
refugees were turned away from US shores; some found refuge in Cuba or
South America, many others sunk or had to return to Europe (with
predictable consequences).  The hope today is that we have
collectively learned a lesson, and are less complacent to ignore other
countries' ""internal affairs"".  The sad reality is that this does not
seem to be the case.

Superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  An awful lot of the
starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical
Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible
malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can
be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They
have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre
idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.

Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against
Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children
are dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the
supposed ""Pro-Life"" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by
fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against
abortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more
of those by fighting for human rights in China.

And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this
ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory
forced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.

A few times a year, a funny thing happens: the bike engine runs
perfectly.  Completely smooth.  Not that it runs poorly normally, but
on these days, it is exceptional.  My theory is that the air density
and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete
combustion.  Needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.

The mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405
freeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stopped
responding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make 
my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then
by pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did
not mind stopping for me.

Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40 
carb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws
tight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do that
on the screws inside of a carb.  At least it was roadside

"There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid.  I thought
I'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant.  I splurged
and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the
highest-paid player is Frank Thomas, at $900K.  I cut some players, like
Kenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunch
of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a
cost of $1 million for the lot of them.  The total team salary is 
$7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300K a player.  If that's too steep,
you can dump Thomas and Bagwell, replacing them with Paul Sorrento and
a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one
of the best teams in the majors.

"Hello,

I'am almost ashame to ask this question. It really looks like a FAQ, but couldn't
find the answer. Anyway...

The original IBM-PC/XT 83 or 84 key keyboard is, in my opinion, still the best
keyboard around. Function keys on the right place (eh.. left place), firm click,
etc. Is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern 386 AT clone?

I do understand that the new AT keyboard has more functionality. I.e. the
typematic repeat rate is programmable etc. It seams to me that the pins &
electrical specs. of the old and the new keyboard are, however, the same. 
Maybe the communication protocol is different? 

Please answer by e-mail. Also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible.
In that case, i will bring the keyboard the museum of obsolete technology.

Thanks,

"}Sheesh, even a trained attack dog is no match for a human,
}we have *all* the advantages.

I agree with this 100%. After all, when you grab under his chin and
are careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head, what is
he going to do -- tailwag you to death? I even had one occasion where
I was unexpectedly jumped by a 130 lb. German Shepherd and grabbed
his upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other. Now I'm
holding his mouth open (no way is he strong enough to clamp down)
and he can do nothing.

HOWEVER, all this macho shit aside, the fact is that when you are
riding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept, it may be unwise
for you to stop and try to deal with the dog, for the simple fact
that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans
before you can dismount and deal with it properly.

By all means, if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention,
STOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away, that is a
victory for the dog -- it drove you out of its territory. It is not
even a qualified victory, it is a victory. If you kick it and STOP,
and sit there, 99% of dogs will say, ""Oh, shit! This guy's serious!""
and back off. Now you have established your dominance over the dog,
and it probably will not bother you again.

Llamas, however, are a different story. If you stop near a llama,
it will just hop on and insist on a ride. And that's if you're
lucky; if it doesn't like you it'll barf you off the bike and

Please pardon my ignorance if this is well known, but what is the current 
rule? 



Maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make,
and award a balk if he exceeds it.  I'd have another question:  who would 
operate the pitch clock?  One of the umpires?  Add another one to the crew?


I'm not sure I like this idea.  I think it would severely diminish the 
number of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic
ploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play (one of my personal favorites).


Ahhh!  I suppose I should read the whole article before I hit the 'f' key,
eh?  Obviously, from what I wrote above, I like this idea.


It may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag, since the 
pitcher knows he doesn't have very many chances to pick off the runner,
so he may hurry too much.  I'd rather see runs scored as the result of 
sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness
that could result from this kind of rule.  So, I suppose there are some
disadvantages to that idea too.



I remember in little league, if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter's
box, even for a moment, we were automatically out.  That may be a little 
harsh for the majors, but seriously, how about putting a limit on the 
batters being able to step out, take several dozen practice swings, pound
their shoes, scratch their balls, etc.?  Maybe forcing them to stay in the
batter's box wouldn't be such a bad idea.  That could save a few minutes.

The Moderator of the General Assembly, the Rev. John Fife, visited our
church about a week ago (just 4 days after Rev. Spahr--it's been a busy
week for our small church!!).  He was asked specifically about the issue
of homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the GA meeting next
month.  Evidently, there are 15-20 known resolutions pending that range
the gamut from ""outlawing"" homosexuality altogether to ""legalizing"" it
completely.  He will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficult
issue that the church has had to deal with since the Presbyterian church
split in two over the issue of slavery more than 100 years ago.  Without
question, the issue may split the church again after we've been reunited
for all of a dozen years or so.  He is hopeful that it will not and is
pushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortion
issue last year as a solution.

He is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we, the
members of the church ""Agree to Disagree"" on the issue, admitting that
both sides have honestly studied the Scriptures and had the Spirit lead
them to different conclusions.  It worked last year when the abortion
issue threatened to do more or less the same thing, and he is hopeful that
the GA can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree
with their own view.

This is an argument for why _you_ don't like religions that suppress
sex. A such it's an irrelevant argument.

If you'd like to generalize it to an objective statement then 
fine. My response is then: you have given no reason for your statement
that sex is not the business of religion (one of your ""arguments"").

The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong
measures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is so
strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to
find a marriage partner.

I do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with
""Kartagener's syndrome"", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome
in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic
infections. ""Situs inversus"" means that organs are on the wrong
side of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting
medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part
by the ""normal"" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in
absence of this, laterality can be ""random."" People with situs
inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their
rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they
can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong
side). 

According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal
recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four
in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current
information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking
about more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your
pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of
which there is probably one at NCSU.",sci.med

well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but 
since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well
worth it to buy the Saturn.

do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up
the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-
car profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.


	Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.  I'd rather pay
more for dealer service that doesn't cut corners to contain costs...

"Some of the messages here seem to reflect the view that the government is
listening in on everything and one will have to hide one's clipper messages

A little perspective might be in order.

The number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low. Law enforcement has to
present pretty good evidence to get even that limited number of
authorizations.

Thus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor
recorded by the government, and for that to happen they have to:
a) Have a pretty good reason, with evidence;
b) Use this sparingly on highest priority ""pretty good reasons.""

I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. Some new
drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data
writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform
a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical
tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*
track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This
becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and
so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it
seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of
boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.

I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed
out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when
digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers
explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT
to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.

Hope this helps.",comp.sys.mac.hardware

Where are all of these studies?  You have cited a few, and my research
shows that there are not that many.  Do Not Confuse a survey as a
study, there is a big difference.  Asking people outside of a polling
booth and adding up numbers is NOT a study.


But this is what you base most of your conclusion upon. Warm

that involve genetics and psychological influence.  There are a

Let's say I have two rectangles on the canvas(see above) 
one intersecting the other...
Now, I would like to delete one of the rectangles.
The way I do it is to create another GC wherein I use the
GXxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly
created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes.
A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel 
locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white, which is 
something that should be avoided.

Is there any way I can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other
rectangle too?
I also would not like to generate an expose event for the affected area
as this degrades performance very badly...

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer

bundled up fans.  

The second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals!

It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to
the Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the
AFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it,
but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with
a lot of baseball fans in other cities.

 Markus had a good season in MoDo in the Swedish elite league, scoring
 22 goals, 17 assists, 39 points and 67 PIM in 39 games.

 As Daryl points out, Markus won't be joining the Pens for this year's
 playoffs, since the World Championships starts April 18th.

 But there is a good chance that Markus will join the Pens before next
 season. MoDo, though, naturally wants to keep their superstars Forsberg
 and Naslund, so the latest news on this is that MoDo is looking for
 personal sponsors for Forsberg and Naslund in order to match the kind
 of money they would receive in NHL.


 Actually, Swedish coach Curt Lundmark is thinking about leaving two
 spots open for additions from eliminated NHLers. It is Mats Sundin and
 Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team, although in a late
 stage of the tournament. Technically, I seem to recall that you can leave
 spots open until 24 hrs before the WC final.

   Hmmmm.  I think, with really large keyspaces like this, you need to
alter the strategy discussed for DES.  Attempt decryption of several
blocks, and check the disctribution of the contents.  I don't think it's
at all feasible to keep 2**80 encryptions of a known plaintext block on
*any* amount of tape or CD-ROM.  And certainly not 2**128 such encrypted
blocks.  (Anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solar
system into a one bit storage device?)
 
   Actually, a keysearch of this kind shouldn't be much worse than the
simpler kind in terms of speed.  It's just that you have to do it over
for *every* encrypted message.
 
   Dumb question:  Has anyone ever done any serious research on how many
legitimate ASCII-encoded 8-byte blocks there are that could be part of
an english sentence?  For attacking DES in ECB mode, it seems like a
dictionary of this kind might be pretty valuable....",sci.crypt
"Hello, 

   Let me introduce a problem:

   When I measure a sinusoidal wave (voltage) with a digital voltmeter, using 
AC mode, my output is an rms value (a peak value over 2 squared). / Right? / 
   When I measure a square wave in the same mode (AC), my output is equal 
to a peak value, actually, to the upper flat boundary of the wave.
   I assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the 
input value, and divides it over the wave period. / Right?/
   Now, I used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted 
by high-frequency harmonics. Ideally, output should be the same, but...
The output value was only about 10% of the previous one! 
   Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter 
actually measure? And what does it show?  

   Related question (less important to me):
   What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with 
analog ones?

"The honest answer to your question about Arabs who were expelled

return.  They may apply for citizenship like any other non-Israeli and
then go to >Jaffa and try to buy their house back from the Jews who now
own it.  

	And now a question and answer for you:  Can the Jews who were
born and raised in Hebron, or their descendants go back to THEIR homes
in Hebron?  The answer is: absolutely NOT, because they were almost all
murdered by their Arab neighbors - the ""palestinians"".

	Now, do I think the Arabs should be allowed to even visit
""their"" homes in Jaffa?  Hell, no.  Bring back the Jews of Hebron, Petah

Yes, as a philosophy weak atheism is worthless.  This is true in
exactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians' disbelief in
Zeus is worthless.  Atheists construct their personal philosophies
from many different sources, building non-god-based ideas in the same
way as Christians build non-Zeus-based ideas of thunderbolts.
Atheists no more *base* their philosophy on atheism than Christians
base theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus.

The ""weak atheist"" position is logically extremely assailable -- any
logical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it
as soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak
atheist.  Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with
attempts to provide such a logical demonstration, and they all fail
miserably.  In fact, most of the people around here who claim the
""strong (as opposed to mathematical) atheist"" position do so on this
basis: not only do we not believe in a god, but also all the arguments
presented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound;
therefore, one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do
not exist.  This doesn't apply to such philosophers' gods as are
defined to be logically undemonstrable, but these are not the gods of
popular religion, and the coherence of such claims is quite
questionable. ",talk.religion.misc

The problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this
passage *is* marriages that were performed on earth.  Jesus' words
seem to me to indicate that He regards His response as the answer to their
question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection.
This being the case, the most straightforward interpretation, in my
opinion, is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those
who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now.  Other-
wise, why would Jesus offer ""but are like the angels in heaven"" as a
contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in
marriage?  We do not have angel-like natures now, but someday we shall,
and when we do, our earthly marriages will be irrelevant.  Or at least,
that's what I think Jesus is saying about the post-resurrection validity of

  then never touched the roster again.  I got wrapped up in my own ""money"" pool
  and decided not to get involved at all with the USENET pool (sorry Andrew
  btw).  The only thing I remember about my team is that I had Joe Sacco and
  maybe John MacLean.  Maybe Francis and Kevin Stevens as well.  Out of
  curiousity I checked the final standings today on r.s.h., only to find to my
  amazement that with absolutely no input, the initial team still managed to
  finsh 79th!  I'm not sure what that implies for those who finished below me
  :)

"On the subject of CS/CN/tear gas: when I received my initial introduction to
tear gas, the first thing that came to mind was the location of the exit.  If
there had been anything in the way, corners to negotiate, doors to open, or 
any other obstacles to movement, I would have had a difficult time exiting the
chamber.  And any concentration of tear gas is hazardous to individuals with
respiratory problems, and the wearing of soft contact lenses in a tear gas 
contaminated area is considered a REAL BAD IDEA.  So hoping the BD's would
peaceably come strolling out the door after being gassed is a bit unrealistic.
If they could have found the door, having them staggering out retching wouldn't
be too far fetched.  Throw in the factor of 50-51 days of being under siege and
subject to psychological warfare, and all bets on functional abilities are off.
Anybody tried to get Amnesty International to jump in on this one?

"Dave Winfield's name does not go



       In terms of PEAK, and I repeat PEAK years, Winfield has Done it  
all. He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs  
many times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300  
while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's  
slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that  
dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was  
one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit  
the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new  
Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence  
since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his  
hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds  
of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an  
uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,  
and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George  
inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the  
Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?  
For 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5  
million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play  
the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should  
give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age  
of Yankee domination.

When I say ""black,"" I mean US-born black people for the purposes of this
discussion.  Hispanic players were in baseball before 1947, and one 
team in the 50's signed lots of hispanics because they went over better
with the local audience than blacks did.  


Don't know.  But remember: this is the country that had special racial
laws for one group and one group only: blacks.  Our national history 
includes huge, long-term, global tensions regarding the black minority; 
the hispanic minority, while often discriminated against, has never been
the object of national obsession.

    You're being too generous to the communists, I think.  In practice,
communism has ""solved"" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_
productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the
rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.  The mass butchery of ""kulaks""
in the USSR is a good instance of this.
    A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which
people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee.  I often wonder
just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would
have been forced to remain in Cuba.  Would they have revolted and killed
him off, or been killed?
    Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in,
load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that
most people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of
obedience, prison, or flight.  This would be a bad science-fiction novel,
if the East Germans hadn't actually done it.  The last person to die
crossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the
back.  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled to

Someone else said something similar.  I will not comment on the

that it is very distressing that at least two people here are
profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOT
like Elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.  

Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An 
instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to 
Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted,
and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were
considered not pure Gypsies but ""mongrels"" formed from the pure Gypsy 
race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between

he complain early, and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis

Pocklington's first option is not to sell or to move, but to sell

  There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago
about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)
As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult
to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:
  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out 
    of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own
    breathing effort (let alone anything else)

  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is
    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled
    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)
    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done
    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen
    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough
    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.

  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough
    gas per unit volume. 

  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs
or interfere with their healing or anything like that...

- I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded

  The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting
  truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables
  LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese,
  the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything

  created with UIL. 


The problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting
XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable

I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone

51 Arrested for Defying Judge's Order at Abortion Protest Rally
The Miami Herald, April 11, 1993

   Melbourne, Florida --   [...]

   Circuit Judge Robert McGregor's order prohibits anti-abortion pickets
   within 36 feet of the property line of Aware Woman Center for Choice.
   Even across the street, they may not display pictures of dead fetuses
   or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic.

   The protesters say the ruling all but wiped out the First Amendment
   to the Constitution.

   ``This is our sidewalk,'' said Joe Carroll, 33, a landscaper who
   marched with his children, Mary Grace, 8, and John, 7.

   ``I am not a rescuer.  I am not a trespasser.  It's just that this is
   my sidewalk.  I am not really protesting abortion.  We are protesting
   denial of our rights of assembly, religion, speech.  This judge is
   trashing the Constitution.''

   The children's grandmother led them away, sobbing, as Carroll and
   his father were arrested.

   Outside the clinic, Eleanor Smeal, president of the Washington,
   D.C.-based Feminist Majority Foundation, called for the Florida
   Legislature and Congress to pass laws as tough as the judge's
   order, which covers only Brevard and Seminole counties.

   ``This cannot go on,'' she said.  ``This is not freedom of speech,
   this is total psychological warfare with violence.  It is ridiculous
   to have to ask clinics to go court-by-court . . . to get protection.''

Well, the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to 
social and political instability, while economic inequality is much more
strongly related.  In virtually all major revolutions including
England (the Puritan revolution), France, Russia and China, the 
revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term 
growth and poverty was declining.  What sets off revolutions is massive
inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom
that social change is possible.

If ""poverty (were) the main engine of social instability,"" this typical
historical pattern would not hold.  In fact, revolutions would have been
far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time.

Sorry, buddy, but some other ""blowhards"" managed to include the ""general
welfare"" in another portion of the constitution.

Article I Section 8: ""The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect

WELFARE of the United States...""

I guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they
said in the preamble.


But as noted above, the constitution doesn't say that, does it?


But since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense
in Article I, Section 8, I guess you'll grant that botha are constitutional
functions.  Right?

	Actually, for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth than
you need, unless there's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed
HDTV.  Also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB,
even using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or
18 should be enough for a moving picture).  1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB (I'm
guessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600, I'm fairly
sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).

Well, as many a bored bike tourer can tell you, the way to steer
sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean.
Say you want to turn left.  You push your body off to the left.
To do this, you have to push against something, and the only
thing to push against is the ground (through the bike).  Well,
the apple guy (Wozniak? or was that Churchill?) says that the 
ground will push you right back.  So, you pushed yourself off to 
the left by pushing on the ground to the right, and the ground 
pushed back toward the left.  Well, that push is on both wheels.  
The rear wheel doesn't care (unless you have serious bearing 
problems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly, which
had the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end),

What do you mean by omnipotent here?  Do you mean by ""omnipotent""
that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates
a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively
useless.

To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean ""being all-powerful"" and
not ""being able to do anything/everything"".

Let me illustrate by analogy.
Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose
further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any
nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country
at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the
US see fit.  The US would be militarily ""omnipotent"".

But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not
interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current
civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.

Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to 
unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But
effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy 
of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to
strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would
ever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it
could actually do, although it had the power to do ""whatever it wanted"".
The US would simply ""never want to interfere"" for such an idea would
be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate
non-interference policy.

God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but
He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what
He, Himself is.

I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning
omnipotence.

I must agree.  There is a dizzying number of c.s.amiga.* newsgroups
already.  In addition, there are very few issues which fall cleanly
into one of these categories.

Also, it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga
groups is already plagued with mega-crossposting; thus the group-split
would not, in all likelihood, bring about a more structured
environment.

Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as
well as covering it in other sections as they apply (i.e. B12
deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy, B12 deficiency in
hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia), yet I sill
hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine:  candida can cause
mucocutaneous candidiasis, and, in already very sick patients
with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients,
systemic candida infection.  I think ""The Yeast Connection"" is
a bunch of hooey.  What does this have to do with how well
nutrition is taught, anyway?

Well, maybe I'm getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast
was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the
mold form.  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds, 
depending on environment.  Candida exibits what is known as
reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues
but exists as a yeast in the environment.  Should we maybe
call it a mold infection?  a fungus infection?  Maybe we
should say it is caused by a mold-like fungus.

It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the

were outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ....

IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His

created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the

Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs
fare when they are once again ""healthy"" if they are playing this well
so far??

Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence,
moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost
at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc.

Just a small tidbit: with the advent of DOS 3.3 and later versions, MS added
a small ""feature"" to the DOS time function.  If a program sets the DOS clock

This breaks the isolation between the two clocks that used to ensure that

There are two 'problems':
(1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit
    for day increment, so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight
    will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the
    meantime, and
(2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date'
    call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So
    unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by
    the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to
    increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost.
My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the
clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which
causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system
'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero
value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS
about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use
DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do
the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed
properly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS
calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time
incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some
other DOS call.",comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for!

V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up
the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster.
This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to
video memory.

Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making 
cards to fit in the other two. 

How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at
130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at

    I think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the
literature and price lists being confused themselves. Since there are
two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have
an FPU it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't.


    Well, then allow me to end your confusion. The C650 ONLY come with
an LC040 in the base 4/80 configuration. If you are not getting this
configuration then you are getting an FPU.


    Good question. I have been wondering that since Feb. 10th.

 
    This is possible, but an option is something that you are supposed
to be able to request when you want it. What Apple has done is given the
buyer a CHOICE between configurations and not an OPTION.


    This is not unclear at all. In fact Apple has included in the ROMs
of those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full
040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching
chips. You pop the LC040 out and pop in a full '040.


    They did? I think I would double-check this. It has been stated

play in this game (because you insist on playing from a losing hand), and you're
finally realizing it.  You will lurk on the board, and keep 
quiet for a while, looking for an area where you are *certain* that you 
are correct, and then we'll see you pop back in again.  Of course, you then
will say that you have merely returned because your life is now ""in order"".",talk.religion.misc
"Well, here it is, NHL in the year 2000.
I got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and 
although I initially thought I had just been taking too many too strong 
drugs now it seems the realization has really begun...  You can see the 
league has already started to move to this direction.

  Now that the Anahaim team is becomming real I'm really beginning to believe
the rest of the 'message'.  I'm sure the future will turn you into believers 
too.  After 2000 the NHL will abandond ice-rinks.  It's so expensive to cool 
down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is 
anyway.  NHL will become a roller skating hockey league.  That way it can 
create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the 
game in their back yards !",rec.sport.hockey

I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion
one way or another on hidden candida infections.  I can
understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with
various general kinds of symptoms, while there is a lack of solid
demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms.
(To understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of past
failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of
hidden candida infection.  There have been quite a few, and the
proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.)

On the other hand, I am happy to read that some people are
sufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred by
suggestive clinical experience, to research it further.  The
doubters may be surprised.  (It has happened before.)

I realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may
not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or
another.  (And, indeed, perhaps some of them do know -- I am the

"Here's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumped
myself and a few others:

What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a large
cache set (through control panel) in your SIMMs?

EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't
rob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?). 
Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the
cache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache
between the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up by
providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into
the SIMM RAM cache?

I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to
really do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar
FastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some
operations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM
accesses?

Please help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci
system described in the EX above.",comp.sys.mac.hardware
"   Here's a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable
   one: Make it voluntary.

   That is--you get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree
   to escrow your key. Otherwise you are on your own.

That's the disturbing part - use of other products IS voluntary, for now,
and the press releases talk about the White House's unwillingness to
decide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear,
and about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long as
they provide key escrow services.  That's a clear implication that
they're considering banning alternatives.

Additionally, use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal -
you're not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except to
the government's friends (e.g. the Australian government)
you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission,

Let's see, if Alexander destroyed Tyre, and people move back, and
they construct houses, and after a while 14000 people live there
and still call it Tyre, it is not considered to be rebuilt. Instead
it's considered to be 'just-some-people-that-got-together-for-fishing-

now a fishing village. When this city (Kristinestad) was founded
in the 17:th century about 1000 people lived there, so the norms
were even more bizarre for dumb Swedish queens who founded cities
along the coast of Finland.

"Hmmm...
  A possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the
distributor register the copy when the software was sold.  The clerk sticks it
in the store PC and asks for the buyers ID. Later, if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser. In addition copies which were
sent to distributors/stores would have a vendor reg # or serial # in order to
track in store piracy.

Possible additional program security schemes would be:
1. having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in
   and registration. (inconvenient)
2. taking dire legal action on anyone caught (expensive)
3. encryption, crc check, self modifying code (limited effectiveness)
4. have an independent watchdog program in the installation/setup config or
   memory manager, etc. which would check the main program's crc. 
   (only as effective as above methods at best.)
5. have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked 
   copies of the program and/or the offenders hard drive. (risky, and probably
   illegal, certainly immoral)

my new ideas aren't terribly feasible to implement as presented, but I thought
if I threw them out people could think of variations that might be effective.
What is the problem with parallel port security keys? I haven't used anything
that had hardware key copy protection schemes, so I don't know what the
drawbacks are. I know the companies that make them claim they're uncrackable,

"Eric (""Damien""?) was presenting his views on Christianity; I'll
respond to a few of his points:


This is certainly a valid objection to religion-as-explanation-of-
nature.  

Fortunately for the convenience of us believers, there is a class of
questions that can never be reduced away by natural science.  For
example: why does the universe exist at all?  After all, the time-space
world didn't have to exist.  Why does *anything* exist? And: is it
possible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely
impersonal cosmos?  These questions which look at the real mysteries of
life -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent
indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be
found *outside* that world, in its Source.



When you say that man is *only* an animal, I have to think that you are
presenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma, if you will.  And one
the requires a kind of ""faith"" too.   By taking such a hard line in
your atheism, you may have stumbled into a religion of your own.

But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow, I hope
you'll do a little research into its history and varieties, perhaps by
reading Paul Johnson's ""A History of Christianity"".  From your remarks,
it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian
religion and not others.  Even an atheist should have enough faith in
Man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth, and
be animated by some enduring values.

Of course, as they said -- ""Local codes may vary"". 


I'm not sure about this.  If the ground connections on the outlets are
connected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the
main panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground
rod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of
the goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hot
to the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.

Ahh, perhaps that's why we've (astronomers) have just built *2* 10-meter
ground-based scopes and are studying designs for larger ones.
Seriously, though, you're never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit
as cheaply as you can build one on the ground, and with adaptive optics
and a good site, the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit
anyway.  Also, scopes in low orbit (like Hubble) can only observe things
continuously for ~45 minutes at a time, which can be a serious
limitation.


I sure as hell does if the 'point of light' is half a degree in extent
and as bright as the moon.  Have you ever noticed how much brighter the
night sky is on a moonlit night?



Existing satellites *are* points of light, but an advertising sign that
appeared as a point would be useless, so I rather think these will
appear larger than a 'typical' satellite.  Also, satellite tracks *are*
ruining lots of plates in the current Palomar Sky Survey.

"We are adding a Motif wrapper to a family of data display programs.

These programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps:
- use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data
  otherwise block (new data comes quite often)
- use msgop to check for messages and if true read them
  otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often)
- update the display according to latest data and messages.

We typically have several of these running in windows,
plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag.
Everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run.

Xt and Xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into.

how to add workprocs that are run during idle time.

We can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc.

Neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt.

Minor point:  Shea Stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but
not with the Jets in mind as the tennant.  The New York Football Giants
had moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was
having problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee
Stadium until 1972).  The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea.
When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the
new AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using
the new stadium.  The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the
Cosmos played soccer in the 70s).  Because Shea Stadium was tied into
the World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to
promote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing
with the Mets).  So the deal was worked out.

This is a lovely area for anecdotes, but I am sure you are on to something.
As a physician, I almost never get sick: usually, when something horrendous
is going around, I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case.
When I do get really sick, it is always something unusual.

This was not the situation when I was in medical school, particularly on
pediatrics. I never had younger siblings myself, and when I went on the
pediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious
challenges that my body was not ready for. Pediatrics for me was three solid
months of illness, and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam!

I think what happens is that during training, and beyond, we are constantly
exposed to new things, and we have the usual reactions to them, so that later
on, when challenged with something, it is more likely a re-exposure for us,
so we deal with it well and get a mild illness. I don't think it is that
the immune system is hyped up in any way. Also, don't forget that the
hospital flora is very different from the home, and we carry a lot of that
around.",sci.med

If Brad's analysis is correct, it may offer an explanation for why the
encryption algorithm is being kept secret.  This will prevent competitors
from coming out with Clipper-compatible phones which lack the government-
installed ""back door.""  The strategy Brad describes will only work as long
as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government
chips.

(It would be nice, from the point of view of personal privacy, if Brad
turns out to be right.  As long as people still have the power to provide
their own encryption in place of or in addition to the Clipper, privacy
is still possible.  But the wording of several passages in the announcement
makes me doubt whether this will turn out to be true.)",sci.crypt

he ones I have seen are all fluorescent tubes. Maybe you could find a

Blue lights. Ultra-violet (by definition?) goes from the blue end of the
spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum (X-rays, cosmic rays etc).

possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility (which people
with false eye-lenses can see easily, since it's your lenses that soak up
most of the UV), however since most people use UV to get other things

There is a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gives you
more CPU power then you had before, and that is with I/O overlap.
With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to ""think"" while disk
operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly
waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take
an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.

So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do.

One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it
possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move
the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
bus mastering.  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface
created for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data
bytes, with no DMA.",comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

Actually, the reboost will probably be done last, so that there is a fuel
reserve during the EVAs (in case they have to chase down an adrift
astronaut or something like that).  But yes, you've got the idea -- the
reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.


Somebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf
item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include
attitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things
like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro
data from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you
don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible
contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get
to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is
done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for
the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from
thrusters and the like).

The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the
reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well
suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing
a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was
relatively short, so it got cancelled.",sci.space

Apple does not authorise sales through Mail Order.  As a result mail order
companies have to obtain their machines by the grey market.

This market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who have
more machines than they can sell.  They come into this state of affairs
by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a better
wholsale price from Apple.  In either case they often obscure the serial
nunber to protect their identity.  As a result the warranty is void.

You may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping.

I should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower prices
thatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealer
cost.  As a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs

"A couple of weeks ago I posted a question concerning
communicating
between VB and MSACCESS using DDE. The answers I received at
that time
allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However,
during
this process I have come up with new problems.

1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic
string. Is
this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS
or VB?

2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the
DDE SQL command,
(provided the above limitation is overcome by using short
field and table
names) but how is one meant to update a database?
   a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.
   b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command
from VB cannot
      be used because when the macro requests information from
VB using a
      second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time-
outs occur.
      (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access
to VB channel
      is initiated, I guess.)
   c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.


   The way I eventually managed to update a database was by
sending key-
   strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This
technique has
   the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must
always be in a
   state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB
sends.

Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect
assumptions?
Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any

So what's your point?  Mark's comment still is valid.  To suggest that
AIDS is ""deserved"" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from 
sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail.
I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided 
the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation.
If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do
we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.

To willingly judge ""others"" as deserving punishment seems to me
to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.  
 

So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in
""deviant"" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS
of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be
infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors,
many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors
carry the risk of transmission.  
 

The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing
daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so
I could get AIDS.  Anyone could, unless they remain forever celibate,

Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or
some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had
elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them
did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal
Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue
and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that
some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.

Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively
swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's

on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:
psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --
maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental

Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.

The reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot? 
In a new Civil War? 

Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and I'm worried
that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
and paper.  

Can people work within the system before trying to break it?  Examine your
history books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic
(or Democratic style) governments.  I think you'll only find one in over
five thousand years of written history.

That's not very good odds.  

Somebody once said something like: ""Armed Violence is meant only to be
used in response to an armed attack.  It is not meant to be used in
agression.  This is the difference between self-defence and murder.""

Let's try to avoid killing things, eh?  There's enough blood shed in the
world, without adding a couple of riots, Civil Wars, etc.

I'm probably overreacting.  But what I've read scared me a lot.  I don't
want my children growing up in a War Zone.

"Dear fellow netters,

From time to time a term like 'Oneness Pentecostals' (or something
similar) has occurred in posts to this group. I also know that there
is a movement called something like 'Jesus alone.' 

I believe in the Trinity and have no plans to change that, but reently
I was made aware that there is at least one person within our church
who holds the view that there is no trinity. In the near future we
will discuss this item, and I feel that I shall ask you, my friends on
this group, for background information.

Can anybody tell me the basic reasons for holding a belief that there
is only Jesus? And vice versa: The foundations for the Trinity?

I shall appreciate both quotes from the Bible and historical
development.

Thank you all.

In Him,

""fete""??? Since this word both formally and commonly refers to
positive/joyous events, your misuse of it here is rather unsettling.
 

I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are
abusive towards the Palestinians/Gazans. Given that, however, there 
*is no comparison* between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in 
Gaza.  

Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying 
entity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements
that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure. 
Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses
(that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are 
inherently in conflict.

Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present
policies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third 
alternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish ""dhimmi""
system with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly ""protected"" citizens.
Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with
regard to Islam's policies towards its minorities?
 

It is a race, then? Between Israel's anti-Palestinian/Gazan
""Final Solution"" and the Arab World's anti-Israel/jewish
""Final Solution"". Do you favor one? neither? 

Since there is justifiable worry by various parties that Israel
and Arab/Palestinian ""final solution"" intentions exist, isn't it
important that BOTH Israeli *and* Palestinian/Gazan ""rights""
be secured?

"I am writing this to find out the following:

1.)	Any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis.

2.)	The name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery.

3.)	Information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer.

My boyfriend, age 34 and otherwise in good health, was diagnosed with 
reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago.  At that time he 
saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta, 
Tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed.  
These treatments were not effective and because the damage was 
worsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was told 
there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissen 
wrap and a ""Hill Repair"".  He opted for the ""Hill Repair"". He recovered 
very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse 
and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva).

The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him 
that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition 
which he called ""Barrett's Syndrome"". If he can't avoid having reflux will 
he necessarily get cancer?

Basically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, I'd 
appreciate it.

I also returned PB memory last summer for credit, and the sales person warned
me not to use US mail.  I did (although I did insure the shipment), and 
apparently Techworks got it.

My minor grip with techworks is that they have different price lists for
different people.  I ordered DUO memory, thinking I got their ""best"" price
because of my employeer.  I subsequently found out that Apple was offering
developers memory for less than techworks charged, called up to complain,
and was told I should have said I was an apple developer and they credited
my card for about 16% of the purchase price.   I like techworks quality

"I have to agree wholeheartedly with this view.  I don't like to see stickwork,
but you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move
(I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back
of their skates when the ref isn't looking.  Makes 'em go down like a ton of
bricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm 
talking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  It also makes the 
player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid
retaliation penalty.  Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of 
position for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the short
side.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with

I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how
deviant the view _as I've articulated it above_ (which may not be
the true view of Khomeini) is from the basic principles of Islam. 
So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from 
the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them. And 
if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam, how 
subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while 
they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an.




In my opinion considering any human being as having a substance
or metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human
being _is_ a heretical notion and one proscribed by Islam. 




Absolutely! I would be interested in discussing this privately and
I am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of
error-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with
the teachings of the Qur'an. However, _prima facie_ such attemptsa
are highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery, explicitly
proscribed by the Qur'an.

Then I set the argument values for window height and width using XtSetArg and
passed it to the toplevel widget with XtSetValues.
When I call XtRealizeWidget, I get a window of the specified size, but I have no idea how I can draw something in it.

We might get further if we begin by accepting that the government 
really couldn't be bothered less about the political opinions of the 
right wing pro establishment types. Just about the only circumstances 
in which I could think that they would be interested in their political 
views would be to recruit them as spooks. They can be guaranteed to give
the government line when it counts. In US history it has been the 
socialists such as myself who have been persecuted. 


Now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which
the administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force
lets try thinking.

In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as
a defense project. Therefore this is not a party matter at all. George Bush
was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook 
remember.

Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply ""ask"" their
chums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be ""nice""
boys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the
chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.

Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the
same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist. People might know
this if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and 
Dewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show 
trials. Ever seen Ed Meese pissed? I have, it was when he said that socialism
and communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter.
It took several minutes before we realised that he was serious.

"Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate
spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw.  Our editors need to
be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character 
displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and
characters on each side, which is useless.

I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183).
This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the
hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel
font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183
character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W.
Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font

To windows 3.0, yes.


It's definitely dated - I used OS/2 1.21, & alpha 2.0 (when msft was
developing it...)


I preferred Windows 3.1 because it was more stable & faster than 3.0,
but could still run more apps than OS/2 (again I made this choice
before 2.0 was released).


No, I've seen no such data.


hee hee.  good one  ;>  ;>


...and one that I've encountered as well...


Hmm. Are you sure?  I'm speaking from my own experience as an
OS/2 _user_. Certainly people in, say, the NT marketing group 
would be in a unique position to present the results of, say,
research on upcoming NT and OS/2 apps (vs Windows and MS-DOS apps).
Part of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does 
not mean one has access to such data (if it exists).


I will confess to, at times, attacking the poster.  


Again, my point was that not all microsofties are here to ""sell"" 
readers on our products (which would conflict with the ""no-ads"" 
philosophy of usenet).  Nor do we necessarily have access to info
that others have.

I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like,

"Im new to Xlib programming. Im having a problem I hope someone here can
help me with. I create a window, and I want it to have some background color,
say red, and draw an oval in it. Further, when I resize the window, I want
to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it
is larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000.

My problem is this: when I resize the window, only the ""original"" part of the
window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else
is a grey..the oval ""tries"" to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that
it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it, but it only shows up in
the region that was the original size of the window when created.

For example, I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I
resize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it is
is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval
only shows up in that 200x200 area.

What am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a 
re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window?

Well I am one of those (apparently) odd people who can sometimes
control their dreams.  For example, I might decide before going to
sleep that I want to repeat a favourite dream, or dream about a
specific place.  Or if I am having an unpleasant dream, I can often
(not always) redirect events to something more pleasant.

I guess I think that the same standards apply in these ""directed""
dreams as apply in waking fantasies or real life (ref Jesus teaching
about looking at a woman lustfully being the same a committing
adultary).

When my normal dreams display themes that I would not conciously chose
to dream about, I take that as a sign that all is not well with my
""inner life"" - maybe I have underlying tenstions/fears that need to be
resolved, or maybe its straightforward sin.  In either case, the cause
needs to be resolved.  

In fact, either case is pretty rare.  I don't
often remember dreams that I don't chose to have.  When I do, they
almost always tell me something important.
I also almost never dream in pictures, and especially not in colour
(in fact I've had precisely one full colour picture dream that I can
remember, and it was definately spiritually important)
I tend to dream in sound, with the odd blurred image, in black and
white.

I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space
limit with the virtual address space limit.  As far as the disk is
concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space.
The limit that causes the message, ""Windows will only use ...,"" is the
amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will
create, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have
when Windows starts.

In the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter:

	PageOverCommit=multiplier

The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:

	This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of
	linear address space the VMM will create for the system, which is
	computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to
	the nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value
	specified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases the
	amount of available linear address space, causing the size of data
	structures to increase.  This also increases paging activity
	proportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify a
	value between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.  To change this entry,
	you must edit SYSTEM.INI.

For a good display, you *must* get an active matrix panel and a *very*
bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel (i.e.
stage must not get too hot). I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked
it, but I needed a brighter projector (I used it with a 3M 920). It is
also too expensive for what you get, IMHO. Prices of active matrix panels
are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to do
with tarrifs being lifted I think). 

In Canadian dollars, the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about
$5000 to $7000 and a good overhead projector about $1000 to $1500. For
that kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beam

relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest
potential.  And, I figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls
better than any salesperson.

Now, I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360

Which is faster?  Is there a noticeable print quality difference,

pages or more) -- any personal experience on either will be appreciated
here?  Which works better under Windows 3.1 (any driver problems, etc)?
Cost of memory, font packages, toner cartridges, etc?  Basically, your
personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable,

forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection
which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population 
(the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was
that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the
state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism 
becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this,
and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile,
and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since
Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is
seen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let's not cloud the
issues with the resurrection.

"I am quite near sighted.

I've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal
holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. In my
left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the
laser was used to ""weld"" this back in place as well.

My right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasional
flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since the
treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often
- several each hour.

The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the
vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. He
says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own
accord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment.

I am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments.
The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations
so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of most
interest to me:

If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course
of action?

If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is
the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect
afterwards.

Do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment
maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.

Many thanks

Do you honestly hold to that tripe Charley? For a start there are enough
current versions of the Bible to make comparisons to show that what you write
above is utter garbage. Witness JW, Mormon, Catholic, Anglican, and Greek
Orthodox Bibles. But to really convince you I'd have to take you to a good
old library. In our local library we had a 1804 King James which I compared
to a brand new, hot of God's tongue Good News Bible. Genesis was almost
unrecognisable, many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been
edited from the Good News Bible. In fact the God of Good News was a much
more congenial fellow I must say. 

If you like I'll get the 1804 King James out again and actually give you
some quotes. At least the headings haven't changed much.",alt.atheism

You are quite correct in your understanding.  The filtering is not
interpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal
you are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an
all-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's
heart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks
that weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the
properly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at
that point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not
unreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things
in realtime if you write efficient code.

In case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response)
filter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out
there know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with
resistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as
the most cost effective method for volume production runs.



Actually, I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that
they have a marketting gimic.  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to
filter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and
give the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that they
charge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build.

I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.  They are
built to a price spec, and that spec says ""cheap as possible!"".

"Last year, I was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an
inguinal hernia.  I couldn't remember doing anything that would have
caused it.  That is, I hadn't been lifting more than other people do,
and in fact probably somewhat less.  Eventually the thing became more
painful and I had the repair operation.

This year I developed a pain on the other side.  This turned out to be
another inguinal hernia.  So I go back to the hospital Monday for
another fun 8-) operation.

I don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen.  I'm 38
years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start falling
apart like this.  The surgeon who is doing the operation seems to
suspect a congenital weakness, but if so, why did it suddenly appear
when I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was younger?

Does anyone know how to prevent a hernia, other than not lifting
anything?  It's rare that I lift more than my 16-month-old or a sack
full of groceries, and you may have noticed that your typical grocery
sack is fairly small these days.  Is there some sort of exercise that
will reduce the risk?

So, who is Mykotronx, Inc.?  It would be nice to know that they were

While we are at it, the chip design(s) should be examined and verified

directly to a modem.

The design examination should be done to the gate level.  Does anyone have
a good idea how to tell if there is a piggyback design on silicon?  The model
would be extra logic sharing pins with the advertised function.  Tip offs
would be circuitry that would ignore incoming data if formats or sequence
is not right.  I can think of only two ways an output pin could be used,
and its possible that might be noticed, but could be edited from the netlist.

I'm an new to this.  Having found some files (public) to look into, I
ftp'ed them to a system I have access to.  I then used kermit to transmit
them via modem to my host computer, a PC-based file system.  I access
internet through modem access to a university mainframe.  From the PC
file server, I pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk
to a SGI Indigo (the SGI is not networked yet).  When I try to uncompress
and un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or I get an error
in the tar process about directories being invalid.

to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up.  Any help is appreciated.

Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when
it comes to their religion. Some take it to the extreme and say that
their religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings
then you won't be ""saved"". It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim
to know what God thinks/wants. Especially when it's based upon your
interpretation of a book. The logic in the above statement is faulty
in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be
correct. It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike.
No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that
there is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call it
what you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it is
just there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer,
meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people may
perceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and the
other is right. As an example, take the question, ""Is the glass half
empty or half full""? You can have two different answers which are
contradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to be
true, does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong.",soc.religion.christian

What is best? Books have been written on that! But in regard to
AeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.
If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero
dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching
the 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.
Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very
concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in
protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I
think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a
difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go
somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)
you can just detach and stow the pants. 

One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for
many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and
petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. 

Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I
got 2-3 inches added to my pant legs. I find the Long suits are not
really that long (I can't imagine how short the standard suits must
be).

Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order
companies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts, 
on-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you
good service, too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good

I don't have to ""try reading a bit"", Pat.  I *work* as a government
contractor and know what the rules are like.  Yes, they sign some
(damned few -- which is why everyone is always having to go to
Washington to see about next week's funding) multi-year contracts;
they also aren't willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties
when they *do* decide to cut the multi-year contract and not pay on it
(which can happen arbitrarily at any time, no matter what previous
plans were) to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a
private space station with the government as the expected prime
occupant.

I'd like a source for that statement about ""the reason they aren't
cutting defense spending as much as they would like""; I just don't buy
it. The other thing I find a bit 'funny' about your posting, Pat, is
that several other people answered the question pretty much the same
way I did; mine is the one you comment (and incorrectly, I think) on.
I think that says a lot.  You and Tommy should move in together.

# Note this contradictory title-  Gay Activity Low.

Not really.  The percentage of gays was low.  Headline writers aren't
noted for accuracy.

# #    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough
# #    examination of American men's sexual practices published since
# #    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2

# #    1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.
# #
# #The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.
# #The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.
# 
# #It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
# #straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically
# #how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.

# Now let's take a quick look at what you are saying.

# The median of a distribution is that variate-value which divides the

Actually, 2% were either exclusively homosexual, or bisexual.  You aren't
readiing very carefully.

"The European Space Agency has involvement with remote earth 
observation, and I presume this includes surveillance (optical etc.).
So it's not just the US/USSR(ex) who are in the game.

But what *is* the game? What can be done with space observation?
The military functions of missile spotting, troop spotting etc. are well
documented, but what about anything else?

The biggest eg I can think of is to get a  metal sensing sat over a
paying country and scan their territory for  precious metals.

More importantly, if radar can spot water vapour (clouds), presumably
a radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers,open water and 
*underground water* from space. This would be a positive life saver
for African or other drought affected countries. Implementing a
clean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such
countries and should cut down mortalities considerably.

So how about it? Is there a charity or government agency that would
pay for a third world country to have their minerals and water deposits
mapped?

Or is this still sci-fi?

Mail replies would be great.

"Greetings all,
	Can anyone let me know status of UK law about riding motorcycles.

	I used to ride one about 12 years ago and never took my DOT test ( One
of a whole list of things I wished I had done when I was young),but I have passed
my car driving test. I now travel from Littlehampton to Brighton every day
and I'm getting PISSED off with the traffic/road works. I thinking about getting
a 100cc bike ( Don't Laugh ) just to get ""Streetwise"" and to take my test, then
to get a bigger one ( 400 to 600 cc ).

	Now I have been told I don't have to do the CBT but what will I have
to do to get a full licence ?

Thanks in advanced

I definitely do.  That's why I don't like going to see games played
on artificial turf :-)


Well, your idea of ""interesting"" differs from mine.  I think
batting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special
effort to get to the game very early in order to see it.  I think the
delaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are
interesting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control
of the flow and timing of the game.  Of course, the umpires can, and
should, intervene when these tactics get out of hand.  As Ryan Robbins
has pointed out, there are rules that cover this.

One of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its
open-endedness with regard to time.  You never know if the game is going
to zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going to
go on until four in the morning.  Likewise, some games are action-packed,
and some games are slow and lazy.  That's fine by me.  Those folks who
want constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel-
surf and cater to their short attention spans.",rec.sport.baseball

8 MB SIMMs do not have to be composite SIMMs, although many (most?) 16 MB 
SIMMs are.  72-pin SIMMs allow two memory banks per SIMM, thus permitting 
the use of 4 Mb DRAM devices (the same ones used on 4 MB SIMMs) to be used 
for two 4 MB banks on one SIMM.  I can't imagine that it would be cheaper 
to build an 8 MB SIMM using 1 Mb DRAMs as the 4 Mb parts reached (and 
exceeded) bit for bit price parity with the 1 Mb parts some time ago.  
It's probably possible to build a single-bank 8 MB SIMM using 4 Mb parts - 
this could cause problems in a Q800.  I'm not sure why you'd want to do 
this, though, as a dual-bank 8 MB SIMM would be cheaper to build than a 
single-bank composite one.",comp.sys.mac.hardware

I have a couple reasons why I would be more likely to trust this algorithm:
	1. The algorithm will be made totally public, once it is patented.
	2. The keys will NOT be escrowed.
Of course if either of these is not true, I will not use this new algorithm.
Since I have never seen this new algorithm, I have no idea how secure it is
yet.

I can't make any judgements about the algorithm itself yet, but I do notice
that the creators of this algorithm are being more open about how the
thing works, and is willing to make it public, showing that after a bit
of scrutiny, any weaknesses will probably be revealed, while we don't know
about Clipper.

Sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg.  There is only one way for
pregnancy to occur: intercourse.  These days however there is also
artificial insemination and implantation techniques, but we're speaking of
""natural"" acts here.  It is possible for pregnancy to occur if semen is
deposited just outside of the vagina (i.e. coitus interruptus), but that's
about at far as you can get.  Through clothes -- no way.  Better go talk
to your biology teacher.
